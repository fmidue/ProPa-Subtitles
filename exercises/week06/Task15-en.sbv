0:00:02.320,0:00:04.080
Let's take a look at Task 15.

0:00:04.640,0:00:15.440
Here we are asked to extend our tree program or
animation from Task 4 into a continuous animation

0:00:15.440,0:00:24.640
where the trees change their leaf
color according to the seasons.

0:00:26.160,0:00:30.800
So the leaves turn orange and
then the trees lose their leaves.

0:00:32.080,0:00:41.280
And also it's not just a single tree but the
tree from Task 4 should get some friends.

0:00:42.000,0:00:47.520
And they all together change the color
of their leaves according to the season.

0:00:49.200,0:00:56.080
Okay, so if you've done the codeword tasks up
to this point this shouldn't be too difficult.

0:00:58.080,0:01:08.160
We have some helper functions given here
that let us do the month letterings.

0:01:08.160,0:01:14.640
And also a transparent color definition
that we can use to make the leaves go away,

0:01:16.240,0:01:17.680
as we'll see shortly.

0:01:18.320,0:01:23.600
Okay, for now, i've pasted

0:01:25.440,0:01:34.320
the tree from Task 4 in here and it just does this
short shaking animation like it did in Task 4.

0:01:35.120,0:01:43.920
So now you should make this
animation never-ending.

0:01:46.240,0:01:56.000
It's easy just we did it with this offset
parameter in our solution for Task 4.

0:01:56.000,0:02:03.120
And this depended on the time whether or not the
tree was doing something or just standing still.

0:02:03.120,0:02:12.480
So we just take out the condition and
now the tree always does the movement.

0:02:15.120,0:02:25.200
Okay, so then let's maybe add the
lettering indicating which month it is.

0:02:26.880,0:02:29.920
We just use the month function.

0:02:32.960,0:02:37.520
Let's start by giving it a fixed value.

0:02:38.560,0:02:41.760
The month function takes an
Integer, basically saying

0:02:42.640,0:02:49.840
which month it is, 1 corresponding
to January up to 12 to December.

0:02:50.560,0:02:51.360
Straightforward.

0:02:51.360,0:02:59.840
Okay, so now it's the month is shown behind the
tree that's probably not the best looking option

0:03:01.440,0:03:10.800
so we translate a bit down.

0:03:16.800,0:03:22.560
Missing an s there; Okay.

0:03:25.680,0:03:29.920
So this is all very static now.

0:03:31.520,0:03:33.680
How do we get the month to change?

0:03:33.680,0:03:46.560
Well, let's define the month
m depending on the time.

0:03:50.320,0:03:51.120
If we look at this

0:03:53.360,0:03:59.840
example, here it seems like every second
the month is changing so let's do this too.

0:04:01.040,0:04:02.080
How do we do this?

0:04:02.080,0:04:14.160
Well, we can floor the time giving us the number
of seconds that have passed, full seconds.

0:04:14.160,0:04:22.640
And then, since you want to get a
value between 1 and 12, we can just

0:04:26.560,0:04:32.400
get the rest from the division
by 12 using mod (modulo) 12.

0:04:32.400,0:04:34.960
And this gives us a value between 0 and 11.

0:04:36.000,0:04:41.840
So we add 1 to it so we get
a value between 1 and 12.

0:04:42.640,0:04:55.840
So this will now start in January and go all the
way up to December and then circle back around.

0:05:00.480,0:05:13.280
Okay, so now we can use this value m to actually
tell the tree which colors the leaves should have.

0:05:13.280,0:05:20.080
So let's just pass this as an additional
parameter to the tree function.

0:05:20.960,0:05:26.640
Add the parameter here, and
for the trunk and the branches

0:05:27.280,0:05:36.240
this is not important but the crown
should receive this information.

0:05:37.280,0:05:41.840
So we also add this parameter to the crown

0:05:43.760,0:05:50.080
and now the color needs to
change according to this m value.

0:05:51.440,0:05:53.200
Let's define a function leafColor

0:05:54.560,0:06:01.360
that takes this Integer and gives us
the color for the respective season.

0:06:03.520,0:06:22.880
So leafColor takes some Integer and returns
some Color, and what should that be?

0:06:23.760,0:06:28.880
Well, let's start with the options we have.

0:06:28.880,0:06:42.480
We have green, orange, and the transparent one.

0:06:43.280,0:06:45.840
And it should be green from ...

0:06:45.840,0:06:51.120
If you look at our reference
here, from March till July.

0:06:51.840,0:06:56.960
So m should be between 3 and 7

0:07:04.080,0:07:17.120
from August to October we have orange
that means m is between 8 and 10.

0:07:17.920,0:07:29.840
And in all other cases the color of the
leaves is transparent so they vanish.

0:07:31.040,0:07:35.040
Okay, so we start out with no leaves
switch to green leaves in March,

0:07:35.920,0:07:43.120
continue till July switch to orange leaves,
and then lose the leaves again in November.

0:07:43.120,0:07:46.720
Okay, very good.

0:07:47.920,0:07:52.240
Straightforward changes, I would say.

0:07:52.960,0:07:57.840
Now let's add some additional trees here.

0:07:59.040,0:08:11.840
They should have different sizes so
we use dilated to scale down a bit.

0:08:12.720,0:08:17.440
Let's add two trees, like in the reference.

0:08:20.240,0:08:28.880
Obviously, we need to place them somewhere,
but, okay, they are behind this big tree now.

0:08:33.120,0:08:35.440
Let's translate this one maybe

0:08:38.560,0:08:47.920
a bit to the right and slightly up so it
looks like it's standing further away.

0:08:50.320,0:08:57.440
And we're doing the same with the
second tree in the other direction.

0:09:08.560,0:09:09.600
Let's see how it looks.

0:09:12.400,0:09:21.840
Okay, this is basically what
we have in the reference.

0:09:23.280,0:09:34.080
Three trees of different sizes changing the
color of their leaves according to the season.

0:09:35.520,0:09:40.800
Okay, there are probably a lot of
other ways to achieve the same effect.

0:09:41.360,0:09:49.840
What's important here is that you remember
to share as much of this code as possible.

0:09:51.360,0:10:01.760
We are obviously reusing the tree and scaling it
down and moving it around, but we also could have

0:10:01.760,0:10:08.000
in theory done all this checking on m, for
example, here with lots of different guards

0:10:09.200,0:10:15.840
and then repeating this right-hand side over
and over again with different color values here.

0:10:24.400,0:10:26.960
Making sure to reuse as much code and

0:10:28.000,0:10:44.720
duplicate as little as possible is the
key here to obtaining a clean solution.
