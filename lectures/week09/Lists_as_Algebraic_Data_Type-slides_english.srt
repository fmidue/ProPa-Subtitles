00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:10,160
Last week we talked about algebraic
datatypes, and specifically about

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,120
computation by pattern-matching which,
of course, was just an additional way to

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,520
program by case distinction. Except that this
time, case distinction was not via if-then-else

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,360
or guards, but via matching against the different
cases that the value of the defined algebraic

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:40,400
datatype can take. We will continue with
this today, insofar as that later, we will

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,920
briefly look a bit more at how pattern
matching drives computation in Haskell

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,560
in general. Basically, also how lazy evaluation
is ultimately driven by pattern-matching. But

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,320
before doing that, we will actually take a look at
lists, which so far in the lecture have received

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,320
some special treatment via specific syntax, via
list comprehensions, which is not available at

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,680
arbitrary other types. But ultimately,
lists are also just algebraic datatypes and

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,920
that's the connection that we
should finally make in this lecture.

139 # slide
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,440
So, let us imagine that Haskell didn't
yet have a predefined list datatype.

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,160
Then we would define one ourselves.
We certainly could do that

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,520
using the kind of definition we saw last
week. And since lists are polymorphic,

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,440
this could look something like this. We
define a list datatype. It's parameterized

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,160
over a parameter because we want to have lists
of numbers, lists of characters, etc. And then

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,240
there are two cases: There is the empty list, and
for historical reasons, this is often called Nil.

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,920
That would be one of the possible constructors for
arbitrary lists. And it doesn't carry a parameter.

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
And on the other hand, there would be a binary
constructor for the case of non-empty lists. And

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:09,600
what should this be called? It's often called Cons,
for "constructor". In a way, if a list is the

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,320
first datatype that you imagine, then maybe simply
using "constructor" as the name of the constructor

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,560
does make sense. Nil and Cons: Nil is the empty
list constructor for constructing an empty list.

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
Cons is for constructing a non-empty list. And
then what are the arguments? An element of the

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,200
carrier type, of the type (a) that we want
to see elements of in the list, and then the

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,440
rest list. And then a recursive occurrence of
what? Of a list of 'a's. This is very similar,

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,000
of course, to the tree datatype we saw last week,
where we had Leaf and then Node with a left

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,200
successor, a label, and a right successor. We don't
have two recursive occurrences here for the list

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,480
because it is not a Tree, it is just a list. So,
it has this slanting to the right. It always has

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
just the right successor. Of course, we could
also draw it as a tree, but this would be a

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,240
very specific tree which always just grows to the
right. Then it's really ultimately just a list.

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,600
That is something we could certainly
introduce. And then, for example,

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,120
the value could look like this. This would be
a two-element list containing the numbers one

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,800
and two because we have the non-empty list and the
label of the node is one, and there is a successor

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,040
list which has the specific element two, and then
as a successor list which is the empty list. And

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,280
this together would be a list of Ints. And how
to compute over this? By pattern-matching. So,

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,600
if we want to compute the length of such a list
from this datatype, then we do a case distinction.

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,880
We get a list of something to Int. That is
polymorphic in the element type here because

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,160
computing the length of a list doesn't depend
on what is stored inside the list. We are just

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,640
introducing structure. And then we had a case for
the empty list. And of course, the length of this

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,160
is zero. And for the case of the non-empty list
and the specific element which is in the first

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,720
position in the list is irrelevant for this. So,
we have this anonymous variable. But we have a

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,040
rest list. And then what is the length of the
whole list? It's one plus the length of the rest

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,960
list. It is a very simple definition which would
give us how to compute the length of such a list.

140 # slide
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,600
And well, now the point is that what we saw on the
previous slide is exactly how lists are actually

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,640
implemented in Haskell. We simply haven't
taken this perspective so far. But that's

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,680
how it is. So, ultimately, somewhere deep
in the standard definitions of Haskell, so,

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,960
in code that we don't see as a user usually,
we would find something like this. Of course,

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,480
it looks a bit strange because it now doesn't have
List and Nil and Cons, but rather some symbols.

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,320
But these are the symbols that we are used to
from list syntax in Haskell. So, essentially,

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,400
lists are also just introduced as algebraic
datatypes. So, there is the type of list (a)

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,360
and it's written with these square brackets. There
are two cases: one case is the Nil constructor,

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560
but it is not written as Nil, it is written
as the empty list as we have seen it so far,

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,040
and then there is the Cons constructor. And for
this actually, the simple colon (:) is used. This

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,160
is used as a prefix operator here. But it can also
be written infix. And what are the arguments of

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,680
this construct? There is, first, just an element
of the type a and then there is a recursive

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,440
occurrence of a list of a which now, of course, is
also written with this list type syntax. But other

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,480
than this… other than these names of the operators
in the data and type constructor, this is exactly

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,840
the same definition as on the previous slide.
And this is how lists are defined in Haskell.

00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,200
It is just not something that's exposed to the
programmer explicitly. You will never see this

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,960
definition in this form because lists are
already there. We don't have to define them

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,760
ourselves. Then what does this mean? Lists as we
have seen them so far. Usually, so far, we have

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,760
used syntax like this. So, in square brackets,
the elements are listed one after another with a

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:19,120
comma. This is simply syntactic sugar for actually
this expression, which says well it's a Cons,

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,280
so it is not the empty list. It is a non-empty
list. It has some current element which is the

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,160
first argument of this colon, now written
infix syntax. It is the first list element,

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
so it should be the 1. Then there is the
rest list which is, again, a non-empty list

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
because it contains the 2. And well, how is
it represented in this algebraic datatype

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,320
syntax? It is a non-empty list. So, it has
this Cons constructor. It has the current

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,040
element 2. And it has the rest list. And this
rest list is the empty list. So, of course, we

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,360
might prefer to write it like this, and the
compiler supports us writing it like this.

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,880
But under the hood, actually, this list
is represented like this. And then,

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,600
since this operator is predefined to be right
associative, we don't need those brackets here.

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,160
Actually, we can also write this list [1,2] in
this form. And this is completely equivalent. So,

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,640
the compiler will silently convert between
these two notations wherever needed.

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,160
And this notation, of course, is the one that
we use for pattern-matching because and then we

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,440
want to decompose a list into its head and rest
list in the pattern, then we can nicely do this

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,280
with this just as, in the previous week, we did it
for the nodes of a Tree, or on the previous slide,

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,680
we could match against the Cons element
and rest list. But for this, we need to

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,520
know about this connection between the lists as
we have seen them so far and this datatype view

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,240
of lists and how this is realized, namely with
this right associative operator, where always,

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,640
to the left, we write infix, we have the
current element, and then the rest list.

141 # slide
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,680
So, let us look at some definitions of functions
on lists that we have already used so far,

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
but not seen the definitions
of. This is the length function.

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,920
And it is defined just as two slides ago where I
did with the Nil-Cons syntax for lists, but now

00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,200
it's actually using the symbolic syntax. So, we
have the base case which matches simply against

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,240
this nullary construct of the empty list. And of
course, the length of an empty list is zero. This

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,960
is a polymorphic list, and we don't care about the
element type. And the empty list is mapped to 0.

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,200
And what about the non-empty list? The non-empty
list will definitely be decomposable into some

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,480
head, which is ignored here because we don't
care about the element. And then this symbolic

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,000
Cons constructor and the rest list. And then, the
right-hand side is 1 + length of the rest list.

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,880
Many list functions, when we look at their
definitions, will be defined like this with the

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
empty list case and exactly the non-empty
list case. We can also have additional cases.

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,960
For example, we could have explicit patterns…
explicit rules for singleton lists or lists

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,920
consisting of exactly 2 elements. And then, maybe
a recursive case for lists of length at least two

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,480
or something. But often we will have exactly these
two cases: an empty list and a non-empty list.

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,000
Some other function: the 'append' function,
also the (++) operator, when written infix,

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,440
actually. But here I define 'append' as a prefix
function that takes two lists over some type

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,080
and returns a list of the same type. How is
it defined? One possibility to define it is

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,960
by case distinction on the first argument,
so the first list can be empty, and then,

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,520
if we append that with some other list,
then we simply get that other list.

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,400
Or the first list could be non-empty, then
it decomposes into the first element and some

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:08,400
rest list. And then appending this with a new
or arbitrary other list is what? It is a list

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:17,520
that starts with x and then has a recursive call
for computing the appending of the rest list and

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,000
the second list. What we see here is that we can
use this data constructor, not just in the pattern

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,000
for deconstructing, but also for constructing
new lists, which is exactly how we used the

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,920
constructors of the Tree type last week. We
had nodes and leaves (Leaf) on the left as

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,240
pattern parts, where we decided which case we
should apply. And when we constructed new Trees,

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
for example, in the insertion example, then
we also used Leaf and Node on the right-hand

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
side for constructing new Trees. The same
happens here with these symbolic constructors.

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Or for example, the head function which, so far
for us, has been a given function that comes from

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,440
somewhere. Where is it defined and how? It has
a polymorphic type. We know this type already.

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,840
How is it defined? It has only one case with
the partial function. Actually, it will fail

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
if we give it the empty list, which we
might also have experienced already. And

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:19,120
why is that? Because it has only one case of the
expected two cases for list processing functions.

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,760
The head function has only one case, namely the
case for the non-empty list. What does it do?

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,920
It matches against the non-empty list, ignores the
rest, and simply returns what it found as the left

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,120
argument of the Cons constructor. And if we call
this on the empty list, we get a runtime error.

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,240
The zip function was also, so far, a primitive
that we simply provided and didn't look at the

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,280
definition of. It could be defined like this.
It takes two lists of possibly different types,

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,800
returns a list of pairs. How does it do that?
It does pattern-matching. And one possibility

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,040
to go about this is to, first, match against the
case where both lists are non-empty. The first one

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,680
decomposes into the first element
x and some rest, and the second

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,680
decomposes into a non-empty list with
the first element y and some rest.

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,240
And what to return then? The pair (x,y)
and whatever 'zip' returns for the two rest

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:22,080
lists. And then in this case, there can be another
default rule which applies in all situations where

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,120
we don't have this first situation where both
lists are at least one element long. And in that

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,240
case, we want to return simply the empty list
because then, if we don't match this pattern

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,440
where both elements are of this form, then one
of them will be the empty list. And then we can

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,280
ignore whatever actually are the concrete lists
that we get, and simply return the empty list.

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:57,840
Something else that becomes apparent here now
is that this recursion pattern or the way

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,360
that lists are seen as special trees which
lean in one direction has consequences for

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,840
how expensive certain computations will be.
So, what we see here in the append function,

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,520
for example, is that it takes as many steps to
compute the 'append' as the first element has

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,200
elements. We see the recursions on the first
list. So, the second element is never really

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,480
examined, but the 'append' is as costly as the first
list is long because that's how many steps we have

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,160
to make. And that means that 'append' is a linear
operation in the length of the first list. And

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:40,320
for example, also, the 'last' function or the list
indexing is linear. The 'last' function is linear

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,320
in the length of the input list, and the index
function… so, the exclamation mark (!!) that I

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:56,160
usually do not want you to use in the exercises…
That operator takes as many steps as long…

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,080
at least proportional to the number of
the list index that you're looking at.

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:16,240
If you have a list and an index at position n,
then that will be O(n) in terms of runtime cost.

142 # slide
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,720
Based on the zip function on the previous slide,
I already commented that we have sometimes choice

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,720
how to structure our definitions. Of course,
that applies to all functions on any datatypes,

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,280
but here we can specifically see this on
lists. And that's a typical case where one

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,360
considers this in particular if one has a
function that operates on more than one list.

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,920
So, for the zip function we could, maybe as the
first attempt, have written it like this where we,

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,760
first, make case distinction on the first argument
of the list and ask if this list is empty,

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,240
and we don't care about the second one, then
we get the empty list. And if the first list

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,200
is not empty and the second is empty, we also get
the empty list. And only then, we have the fully

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,600
recursive case where both lists are non-empty.
That's one way to write this definition. We

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,160
could also have used anonymous variables here
and here, of course. But still, we would have

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,320
had three cases. And the version from the previous
slide is completely equivalent. By, first,

00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,800
checking against this case, making this our first
choice. Remember, if we have several equations for

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,400
a function, they are tried from top to bottom. So,
if we move this to the first place, then we would,

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:37,520
first, check against the case that both of the
lists are non-empty. And if that is not the case,

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,400
we would anyway run into one of these cases. We
might as well say where all the other cases return

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,760
the empty list, as was done on the previous slide.
This is actually not, at all, somehow only working

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,920
for finite lists. Both versions, the one from
the previous slide, and also the one given here,

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,680
work just fine with infinite lists. That is
because they will only consume the lists as

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:11,280
far as needed. For example, if we have one
or two in the list, then often we will apply

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,040
this case which, on the previous slide, was
the first one, and here comes after we haven't

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,440
found an empty list in the first or second
position, and only if one of the lists

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,160
is actually finite, then after some finite
number of steps we would end up in one of

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,080
these cases where we return the empty list. But
if, for example, both of the lists are infinite,

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,640
then we would always apply this function and
return an infinite list. And if there is a context

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,920
which takes only the first 200 values from the
empty list, then also the zip function would only

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,960
descend up to 200 elements deep into its two
arguments because that's what this equation

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,160
says. It takes one element at a time from both
lists. That's also how lazy evaluation works.

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:08,080
Later, we will look at another example where
we talk about how evaluation works. There is

00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,080
nothing special about first order here. This is
a polymorphic function which is of first order.

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,440
We have two normal lists (first-order data),
but also, if we have functions as arguments,

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,720
then of course we can't pattern-match on the
functions. But if we have a function as a list

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,640
argument, then function definition works by case
distinction on the list element and the function

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,840
argument is simply carried around used where
appropriate as we will see on the next slides.

143 # slide
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,680
Let's consider the map
function. When I introduced it

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,280
two weeks ago, I explained that it is
essentially doing what a list comprehension

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,680
does when it applies a function to each
element from an input list used as a generator,

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,280
but I also mentioned already that that is
not to be the definition of map. Also,

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,040
this is not exactly the definition of map because
actually, map is probably defined with some

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,560
other higher-order combinator in the prelude.
That also depends on the compiler version or

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,680
on the concrete compiler. I am pretty sure that,
in GHC, it is not defined exactly like this,

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,320
but this is a way to define the map function. It
takes a function argument which is a function.

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,120
It takes a list. What does it do? What it needs
to distinguish is the list the empty list? Then

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,080
mapping whatever over it will still be the empty
list. If it is not the empty list, then what

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,080
happens if we map the function f over a non-empty
list consisting of x and the rest list? The first

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,720
element of the result list should be the result of
applying 'f' to 'x', which is what happens here,

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,000
and then we have a recursive call which applies
map with the same function to the rest list.

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,320
And again, this is exactly how computation
works, driven by pattern-matching ultimately.

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,760
And of course, relatedly, we can do similar
things for other datatypes. I already

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,480
mentioned this in the context of whole-meal
programming, that while we mainly looked at

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,320
lists and list computations, also for
other datatypes we can have, for example,

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,000
higher-order functions which correspond to things
that, on lists, correspond to list comprehension.

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,160
While we don't have Tree comprehensions like we have
list comprehensions, we do have tree versions of

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,120
typical functions that we apply to lists in order
to get the wholemeal program. So, for example,

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,800
there is a treeMap function that we can easily
define which takes a function, takes a Tree

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,080
polymorphic in some type, and it returns a Tree
of the other type driven by what the function

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,120
is mapping from and to. What happens if we map
over an empty Tree? Then we get an empty Tree.

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,720
And for the recursive case, we simply get a new
Node while we have applied the function to do

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,920
label at that Node, and we have two recursive calls
of the same function with the mapping function.

144 # slide
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Yet another example. Earlier, we mentioned, when
we talked about higher-order functions, is foldl1

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,320
function which was used there, for example,
for summing the elements of a list.

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,800
Then I used the plus operator (+)
for this binary operator, and some

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:39,120
finite list. This was a list of numbers, and we
used the plus operator here, then we got the sum

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:46,080
of the list elements. Hopefully now, we can
imagine how this would be defined using this list

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,080
pattern-matching syntax. On this slide,
let me not define exactly this function,

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,720
but instead, a similar one, the 'foldr' function.
Because that one is more prominent and more often used.

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:10,080
But in concept, it is a similar function. It uses
the r-mnemonic here instead of 'l' because it thinks

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,840
about its operator as a right associative one,
whereas here this was used left-associatively. And

00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,400
the one (1) stands here for “we should give this
function a non-empty list”, so, a list of at least

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,600
one element. The foldr function also works on the
empty list, as we see here. So, it returns something

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,360
useful also for the empty list. And additionally,
the foldl1 function has problems with infinite

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,200
lists, while foldr works with infinite lists as we
can see basically by the fact that even if this

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,920
would be an infinite list, so xs would not end at
some point, we still can compute something because

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,920
at least we can compute 'f' of 'x' and whatever,
and maybe this whatever is not used depending on the

00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,160
'f'. And then we can produce some productive output
even if we never reached the end of the recursion.

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,480
This is actually something I will briefly discuss
in a separate video on the whiteboard app.

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,280
So, what's important in this? We have this
foldr function. It is polymorphic. It takes

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,640
two arguments and an operator which is considered
right associative, and some kind of start value,

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,160
and it takes a list of elements of this type
which is the first input of this binary operator,

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,720
and it returns something of the same type as the
starter element. What is the idea? If we have the

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,240
empty list, then we simply return this constant
in a sense. So, this b is returned as the final

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,920
value here. If we have a non-empty list, then
we can do a recursive call on the rest list,

00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,760
and combine whatever comes out of this recursive
call with the current element via the provided

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,360
function f. As I said, if this function f, for
example, doesn't need its second argument, then we

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,680
can compute something from this even though this
recursive call (maybe) wouldn't even terminate.

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,840
I will talk through some examples in
the whiteboard video based on this.
