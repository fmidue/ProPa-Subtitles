0:00:01.440,0:00:03.440
Okay, so this is the promised video

0:00:03.440,0:00:07.760
about how pattern-matching drives
lazy evaluation in Haskell.

0:00:08.560,0:00:15.200
And you should probably watch this while
having the slides at slide 146 open.

0:00:15.200,0:00:20.080
Because there I have the function
definitions I'm going to use.

0:00:20.640,0:00:24.160
So, I will not repeat them here,
but they are on that slide.

0:00:25.040,0:00:29.840
And what's also on the slide is this
expression I think that I wanted to evaluate.

0:00:30.960,0:00:33.600
And well, let's go about this.

0:00:33.600,0:00:35.040
Okay, so you have a definition of f

0:00:35.040,0:00:36.880
and you know what head and tail are.

0:00:36.880,0:00:38.640
Now, how do we evaluate this?

0:00:39.440,0:00:42.480
Well, you could say, well, let's
simply evaluate this 3 + 1 to 4.

0:00:42.480,0:00:43.440
But that would be wrong.

0:00:43.440,0:00:47.120
Because we only want to evaluate on demand.

0:00:47.120,0:00:49.680
You only want to evaluate things
that are needed, actually.

0:00:49.680,0:00:54.160
And we can't tell this now upfront that
this will be eventually needed, this 4.

0:00:54.160,0:00:56.560
Because maybe this 'f' discards that element.

0:00:56.560,0:01:00.560
And then we shouldn't compute 3 + 1 is
4 if we are not going to use the thing.

0:01:00.560,0:01:02.400
So, how do we instead proceed?

0:01:02.400,0:01:06.320
Well, we have to see what we have to know in
order to know what the outcome of this is.

0:01:06.320,0:01:08.320
Well, we have to know what head of something is.

0:01:08.880,0:01:12.560
And we can't do this without having
computed this something at least as

0:01:12.560,0:01:15.440
far as being able to tell what the head is, okay.

0:01:15.440,0:01:17.760
So, that's why we need to go inside.

0:01:17.760,0:01:22.160
Well, we can only compute the
tail of something if we at least

0:01:22.160,0:01:24.240
know whether that something
is the empty list or not.

0:01:24.240,0:01:27.840
So, we will have to compute
this 'f' of that list.

0:01:27.840,0:01:30.720
Now if you look at the slide, the
definition of 'f' then it's defined by

0:01:31.280,0:01:34.480
case distinctions by pattern-matching on
the empty list or the non-empty list.

0:01:35.120,0:01:35.360
Right?

0:01:35.360,0:01:40.160
So, it doesn't have a case for two element lists,
but it has this case with the empty list or with

0:01:40.160,0:01:43.280
the cons constructor (':')
between some variables x and xs.

0:01:44.320,0:01:47.200
Okay, so how do we proceed then here?

0:01:49.200,0:01:52.960
Well, we should keep in mind what

0:01:53.680,0:02:03.600
this list is actually represented like,
namely as something like this, right?

0:02:07.200,0:02:09.680
In this list view of data constructors.

0:02:09.680,0:02:14.480
And then if you look at the definition
of f, then there's a case for x : xs.

0:02:14.480,0:02:16.640
So, this will be x and this will be xs.

0:02:17.280,0:02:25.760
So, inside this head and tail context, we use
the right-hand side of the second 'f' equation.

0:02:26.560,0:02:32.960
And what that then means is that we
should apply 'g' to x, so to this 3,

0:02:34.480,0:02:38.400
and have cons (':') and 'f'
applied to the rest of the list.

0:02:39.440,0:02:41.840
Right to this list.

0:02:41.840,0:02:45.120
And again, we don't evaluate
the 3 + 1 to 4 at this point.

0:02:45.120,0:02:48.800
Because we are not yet certain
that this will actually be needed.

0:02:48.800,0:02:51.280
So, this is the next expression
that you should look at.

0:02:52.080,0:02:55.200
Okay, then we again have to see
what do we have to compute where

0:02:55.200,0:02:58.720
we want head of something, so we should
know what the head of the thing is.

0:02:58.720,0:03:02.160
We should see the data constructor
for the non-empty list.

0:03:02.720,0:03:04.480
So, we can't yet compute the head.

0:03:05.360,0:03:08.720
We have to compute the thing
which appears nested inside.

0:03:09.600,0:03:12.160
Okay, should we maybe now compute g 3?

0:03:12.720,0:03:13.760
No, we shouldn't.

0:03:13.760,0:03:17.280
Because the tail will
actually just cut this part.

0:03:17.280,0:03:21.360
So, the tail of a non-empty list
is the remainder of that list.

0:03:21.920,0:03:30.320
So, yes, similarly to the head definition
the tail definition would look like this.

0:03:30.320,0:03:31.680
So, this x is not used.

0:03:31.680,0:03:35.680
So, we shouldn't compute the g 3, that
would be a superfluous computation.

0:03:36.720,0:03:38.720
That wouldn't be lazy, but we want to be lazy.

0:03:40.640,0:03:47.200
Okay, so instead, the tail of
something rest list is the rest list.

0:03:47.760,0:03:59.840
So, at this point, we will simply project
to this 'f' of this singleton list.

0:04:00.400,0:04:01.440
So, this is the next step.

0:04:03.040,0:04:04.080
Not computing this.

0:04:05.120,0:04:06.960
Okay, so g 3 will never be computed.

0:04:07.760,0:04:10.480
Okay, so we have the head of something again,

0:04:10.480,0:04:14.400
we can't yet compute the head, we have to
compute the thing inside these brackets.

0:04:15.120,0:04:15.920
Now, what is this?

0:04:15.920,0:04:18.240
This is an 'f' call, it's not the empty list.

0:04:19.440,0:04:20.960
It's basically 'f' on this.

0:04:20.960,0:04:23.440
So, again, the second equation of 'f' will apply.

0:04:23.440,0:04:24.480
And what does it do?

0:04:24.480,0:04:28.000
Well, inside this context, of course,

0:04:28.000,0:04:32.960
we get a 'g' call on the first argument
on the first element of that list.

0:04:35.120,0:04:37.600
And again, we don't compute
the 3 + 1 at this point,

0:04:37.600,0:04:39.680
because it's not yet clear
that we will need this.

0:04:40.880,0:04:43.040
And what is the remainder of this call?

0:04:43.040,0:04:48.960
Well, it is 'f' applied to the rest list, and
well, the rest list here is the second argument.

0:04:48.960,0:04:49.920
It's the empty list.

0:04:53.680,0:04:57.440
Okay, now we can actually compute
the head because now inside the

0:04:57.440,0:05:03.240
argument position of the head, we really have
something of the form head element rest list.

0:05:04.640,0:05:10.640
Okay, so this now reduces to g (3 + 1).

0:05:10.640,0:05:13.280
And again, we didn't compute
the 'f' of the empty list.

0:05:13.280,0:05:14.480
This will, of course, be the empty list.

0:05:14.480,0:05:16.080
But we don't compute this at this point.

0:05:16.080,0:05:17.760
Because this is discarded by the head function;

0:05:17.760,0:05:21.040
we don't compute some subexpressions
that are not going to be needed.

0:05:21.840,0:05:25.120
And what's going to be needed
comes out via pattern-matching.

0:05:26.160,0:05:27.120
Okay, so we have this.

0:05:27.760,0:05:31.120
Now we have to compute the 3 + 1,
because if you look at the definition of

0:05:31.120,0:05:33.760
g on the slide, then you'll see
that it does a pattern-matching.

0:05:33.760,0:05:37.840
So, we have to know: Is this first
argument some certain constant that

0:05:37.840,0:05:41.920
appears in the first occasion of the g function?

0:05:41.920,0:05:45.600
Okay, in order to decide this, we have
to actually now compute this value.

0:05:46.240,0:05:50.080
Okay, so now we compute g 4.

0:05:50.080,0:05:51.600
Well, we reduced this to 4.

0:05:51.600,0:05:53.280
So, now we have to compute g 4.

0:05:54.320,0:05:57.520
Okay, look, again, at the definition
of g, it tests two cases.

0:05:57.520,0:05:59.920
The first case doesn't match
here, because we have a different

0:05:59.920,0:06:04.960
constant number in the first case of
the 'g' call of the 'g' definition.

0:06:04.960,0:06:09.120
So, we have to apply the second one
and the second one is g n is n + 1.

0:06:09.760,0:06:11.040
Okay, so now it is,

0:06:11.040,0:06:13.840
of course, the four,
so this reduces to 4 + 1.

0:06:14.800,0:06:16.240
And then we get 5.

0:06:17.040,0:06:21.920
Okay, so of course, you would have got the same
if you had simply put this into the interpreter.

0:06:21.920,0:06:24.480
But now you also see what essentially the kind of

0:06:24.480,0:06:27.760
steps the interpreter will do
in evaluating this 5 here.

0:06:27.760,0:06:32.480
And most importantly, you will also
see which parts are not computed.

0:06:33.280,0:06:34.160
Or when they are computed.

0:06:34.160,0:06:38.880
So, this is not computed upfront; it's only
computed when we realize that we actually need it.

0:06:38.880,0:06:40.160
And some things are never computed.

0:06:40.160,0:06:42.720
g 3 is never computed.

0:06:42.720,0:06:44.800
And the empty list is also not computed.

0:06:45.600,0:06:46.080
Okay.

0:06:46.080,0:06:52.880
Plus, you also need this perspective in order
to be able to match some arguments like this.

0:06:53.680,0:07:00.240
Okay, and the same kind of
example and derivation/evaluation

0:07:00.240,0:07:09.760
applies to all Haskell evaluation,
to all Haskell programs.
