31 # slide
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,040
Back to slides for a while.

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,080
As a brief recap, both from last week and
actually also from the preceding video today,

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,440
let me recall a few notions/observations.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Before we will then, again, see this both
for the CodeWorld library, specifically,

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,360
and then also for some more practical
examples; to play around with, and also

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
more expressivity in terms of new syntax
features that we haven't seen yet.

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,120
So, what we discussed previously was
expressions, as opposed to commands:

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
expressions as syntactic structures.

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,640
And I gave you, as a way to remember this or to
distinguish what are expressions in languages that

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,840
you know, for example: it would be the things that
could occur after "=" in a variable assignment.

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,520
As things that evaluate to something,
then can be assigned to a variable.

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
So, that would be the things that you would
call an expression, also in other languages.

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
And the point was that in Haskell, for
example, basically everything is an expression.

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
Programming there consists, almost
exclusively, of expression writing.

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,760
What are values?

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Values are the results of
evaluating an expression.

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,400
So, they are obtained by combining
values of subexpressions.

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,640
There also was this idea that
evaluation order should not be relevant.

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,400
If you have an expression which is combined out
of subexpressions in such an expression-style way,

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
values can actually be replaced by expressions
and expressions can be replaced by their values.

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,400
In a language where all that matters
is expressions and their values.

00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,120
Opposed to that are commands, syntactic structures
that are not so much characterized by what,

00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,960
if anything at all, they evaluate to,
but rather by what effect they have.

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
So, things like assignment statements
that would change storage cells,

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,800
or keywords/commands for looping, or things
that are not about evaluating some expression,

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
but about doing something
or about having an effect.

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,680
And that's a different kind of
structure in a programming language.

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,880
And it's still a more dominant structure
in imperative programming languages,

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,560
because they are about doing something
rather than about calculating values.

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,640
And there was this important observation already
alluded to above, that if you are in a pure

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
setting (so you don't have commands, and also the
expressions that we have are pure expressions),

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,880
then any two expressions that have the
same value can be replaced by each other,

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,720
without changing the behavior of the program.

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,360
That's what I did when I calculated
with programs in the previous video.

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
And that's also what, for example, a
compiler can use for optimizing a program.

32 # slide
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,880
More specifically for the CodeWorld sublanguage:
there now, our expressions are about pictures.

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,160
So, the values of expressions are pictures or

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,000
ingredients needed for Pictures,
like colors, coordinates, etc.

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
They can be named, etc.

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,320
You have done this already in
the first exercise, of course.

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
And for this, you have used functions/operators.

00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Here I list some along with their types.

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,680
You were not forced to use types in the first
exercise tasks, but if you have looked at the

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,200
documentation, you would
have found something like:

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,440
The 'circle' function takes a radius, which
is a real number, and gives a picture.

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,960
There are other notations,

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,800
that are not exactly like that in Haskell, but we
have them on this slide, in order to be similar to

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,240
functions and their types, the way you are
used to from mathematics, from set theory.

00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,320
So, for example, the "polygon"

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,840
function is also about returning a picture, but
it actually takes a list of coordinate pairs.

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,040
Of course, a pair of coordinates is what would, in
mathematics, be presented by a Cartesian product.

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,880
So, taking R x R in order to
get pairs of real numbers.

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,560
And a list of such things will be an argument
of the 'polygon' function to get a picture.

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,520
For "colored", you take two arguments, a
color and a picture, and return a picture.

00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,120
We talked about this before.

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
And likewise, for more than two arguments,
you get something like a three-way

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,760
Cartesian/cross product of two times a
real number (for x- and y-directions)

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,320
for a movement, and then some
picture that you want to move.

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
And the result is a picture,
namely, the moved picture.

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,080
Actually, concerning the types: You may
have seen this already, for example,

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,240
in error messages in CodeWorld - if your program
didn't work, and there was an error message,

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
then you might have seen the types of these
functions, and they looked a bit different.

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
I will come back to this later.

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,640
That actually, for syntactical
reasons, or reasons

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,200
about the organization of function application
in Haskell, you will rarely see this cross.

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,000
You will see some other syntactic means
of expressing, for example, a binary

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,480
function or a function with three arguments, etc.

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,200
But mathematically, in
spirit, this is what we have.

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,760
For example, a combination: the and-symbol (&)
here takes two pictures and returns one picture.

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
I already talked in the previous video about
properties/laws that we can think about.

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,840
They are like arithmetic laws in mathematics.

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,880
But they now talk about the
functions that we have in our domain.

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,480
In this case, I talked
about rotation and coloring.

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,920
But I also started writing down the
law for translation and coloring,

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,840
and this would be the complete version of that.

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,520
And the list of functions that we consider grows.

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
So, there will be more things
that we can do with pictures.

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,720
Then you could always also think about new laws.

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,040
You don't have to prove them, of course.

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,760
In this lecture, the point is: If you
are aware of reasonable properties/laws

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,920
about the functions that you're working
with, then you can write nicer programs.

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,960
And you can refactor your
programs with much more confidence

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,840
than by just guessing what
you should do or not do.

33 # slide
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,920
Now, inside the CodeWorld library we can make the
next step and move from pictures to animations.

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,400
That's a very small step, actually,
because an animation, as I already

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,440
indicated before on an intuitive level,
is just a picture that changes with time.

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,280
And mathematically, such a dependence on time
would simply be by introducing parameters.

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,280
This is an example you see here, which
is a small variation of the example from

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,640
last week, where we basically had
no animation here, just a drawing.

00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,000
We didn't have this t parameter in the
recent example that I walked through

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,280
in the expression-style discussion in CodeWorld.

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,200
In one of them, there was a fixed value here.

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,040
So, there was a colored red triangle
that was moved to somewhere.

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,880
And now, by saying "well, actually, let
me make this dependent on the time t",

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,120
this is already an animation.

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,720
I simply have to change the call above, here, to
also express that now I want to have an animation.

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
And I am making this happen by
the function here, and also,

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,040
instead of defining a scene as a Picture,
I define a function from Double to Picture.

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,840
So, this is something like the R from the previous
slides, the mathematical R, the real numbers.

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
So, the function depends on time, so
its first variable is the parameter t,

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,440
in the straightforward mathematical
interpretation and style.

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,400
This parameter is never set by us here.

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,120
So, you never see me, in this short piece of
code, setting the t to some specific value.

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,680
We can do this and play
around with the example code.

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,920
We can also consider specific calls of
the 'scene' function with the values 1, 2,

00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,080
3, whatever, with specific values.

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,000
But for an animation this is not
something that I, as a programmer, do.

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,520
Another observation is: There is no
for-loop or other explicit control.

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,240
If you were considering a moving
triangle in another language,

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,200
you might consider that you write a for-loop,
which actually takes a variable t for time,

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,280
and then steps through different time steps:
t = 1, 2, 3, 4, whatever, in a for-loop; and

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,440
then use this to make repeated calls to a drawing
function to simulate or animate a moving triangle.

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,400
That's not what's happening here,
because we're more concerned about

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,480
expressing this mathematically.

00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,440
And mathematically, this expression
is the perfect way of describing what

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
it means that the position of
the triangle depends on the time.

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
So, there is no explicit control.

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Instead, somehow, this
animationOf-construct takes care of this.

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,240
And as a user of the library, we
don't need to know how it does that.

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,040
It does that by making clever decisions
about how often to call the 'scene' function,

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,680
maybe in sync with the browser's refresh rate,
deciding when and with which values it should

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,760
call the 'scene' function, and then combines all
the pictures that result into a nice animation

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,520
(that can be shown in the browser, in the
case that you use CodeWorld online, or

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
in other ways if you use it offline).

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,680
The point is, the animationOf
construct does this.

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,160
It is a function which takes another function,
in this case a 'scene' function, as an argument.

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
It is not something that we
have implemented ourselves.

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,880
It's a part of the library, or semantics
of what an animation is in CodeWorld.

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,000
And we can simply use it, and
will make more and more use of it.

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Also you, in the next exercise tasks.

34 # slide
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,840
The use of functions to
describe dynamic behaviors

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,000
shouldn't come as a surprise to
you (or most of you), I think.

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,840
Much of engineering outside
computer science works that way.

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,800
And at least from your high-school physics, you
also have seen many examples in mechanics, where a

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,200
lot of behaviors or situations in
experiments are described that way.

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,000
So, let's look at this case
of, basically, throwing a ball.

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,240
I think in physics schoolbooks, this
would be called "parabolic throwing".

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Where we throw something at a starting angle.

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
And if you looked up in such physics textbooks

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,480
how the experiment can be described, then you
would find something like these formulas here:

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,800
describing the x- and y-positions based
on the parameter t (the current time).

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
And there is some starting

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,640
velocity in the x-direction and some
starting velocity in the y-direction.

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240
And then since in the x-direction
it is a uniform movement, it's

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,360
basically this multiplication of
this factor and the current time.

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,440
And in the y-direction, because there's also
gravity, which basically leads to this curve

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,680
that results here, we also have
to have this other component.

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,800
This is the mathematics of what
throwing a ball in this fashion means.

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,720
And that is a complete description
of the dynamics of the system.

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,320
And it also serves as the
implementation if you like.

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,400
So, in CodeWorld, you could
write a small program which

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,280
basically animates this movement of this ball.

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
And what you write down is
really what we see above

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
from the mathematics side, except that
you have to write it in Haskell style.

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:52,640
You will recognize these expressions down here for
the x- and y-values, of course, in program syntax.

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,000
Not, for example, this fraction syntax here.

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,880
But apart from that, and
setting some specific parameters

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,760
and specific constants, that's really
the implementation of what we see above.

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,840
Very closely matched with the
mathematics/physics side to programming.

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
Also, this is not something
that's super surprising.

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,400
But it is also interesting because
it will be useful for illustrating,

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,600
by playing with this program,
the use of specific concepts.

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
For example, scope.

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,160
One difference that you
might already observe here,

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,520
is for example that the x and y up here are
explicit functions that take this t parameter.

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Whereas down here, where I compute x
and y, because I want to use them for

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,680
describing the position of my small ball (which is
this "circle 0.1"), they are not functions of t.

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
Why don't they have to be functions of t?

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
Because they are local definitions.

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,840
So, we describe the 'scene' function.

00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,520
The function takes an argument t.

00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,280
Then there on the right-hand
side, the t is in scope.

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,400
It can be used.

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,080
And if I introduce a local definition here
for x (or even several ones for x and for y),

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,680
then the t is in scope, but I don't have to, like
above here, explicitly pass the t as an argument.

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
This is something that you can play around with.

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,160
So, what happens if you move
these x and y to the top level?

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,560
I talked about organization of programs before.

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,840
Having local definitions or top-level/global
definitions is something that we can observe here.

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,360
Also, this is a program largely without keywords.

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
Because we are in expression-style.

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Just as the mathematical world doesn't know
keywords, only knows mathematical symbols,

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,080
variables, operators and combinations
of expressions; the same applies here.

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,040
So, there are no keywords.

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,400
The "where" could be
considered a keyword, probably,

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,360
but it's really just something
for organizing our expression.

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
It's not like the "while" or

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,520
"for" loop keywords in an imperative language,
that really drives the whole computation.

00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
So, this "where" here is a keyword, but it's

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,680
really just a helper for organizing
our mathematical expressions.

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
What's really important about this
program is the expressions that we build.

35 # slide
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,500
Speaking of expressions, which
I seem to do all the time:

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:25,040
We will, of course, need a few more ingredients
than just operators, constants, and variables.

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,600
So, I gave this idealized idea that
there are only mathematical functions,

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,960
mathematical symbols, variables, and
constants to build larger programs.

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,320
There will be something more needed,
but it will still be expression-style.

00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,200
So, the "where" keyword from the
previous slide was already an example,

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,640
where something was introduced that is not just a
value or something that is itself an expression.

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,040
So, it's a keyword for organizing expressions.

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,840
And actually, there will be
further syntactic constructs

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,480
that allow us to build more interesting,
larger, and more useful expressions.

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
And I call this "rich expressions".

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,840
I will introduce these features
one by one in the following

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,480
material, and in each case motivated
by some example in CodeWorld.

36 # slide
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
Let us discuss this case.

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,760
Let's assume that, differently from the example
we saw today (where we had continuous distribution

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,400
throughout time, so our function was dependent
on time to express continuous distribution

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,480
of pictures through time, namely as animations),
we instead want to have a discrete distribution,

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
in some sense, throughout space.

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,280
So, we don't want to have a moving triangle,

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,800
but maybe we want to have many triangles
that are static but are separated in space.

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,960
So, they appear at different places
on our coordinates plane, for example.

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,960
Now, of course, the magic

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
of the 'animationOf' function provided
before is not applicable anymore.

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
Because there is no obvious way how to distribute

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
things throughout space,
unlike time moving forward.

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,840
So, for every point we simply
have to say where our triangle is.

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,680
Now, we maybe want to have a
certain pattern on the screen,

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,680
how these different triangles
should statically be placed.

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,000
And that's not something that somehow can come
from something like the 'animationOf' function.

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,360
So, now it is something that
the programmer would have to do.

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
And of course, the programmer could do that.

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,000
The programmer could take our old 'scene' function,
which given the parameter places the triangle at

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,520
some point, and previously used this parameter in
the 'animationOf' function to express movement.

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Now we could simply say: Let's instead make

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,680
individual calls to the 'scene' function
with different values for this parameter.

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,440
Then, certainly, we can express the
places that are of interest to us.

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,280
But then we would have to replicate these calls.

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,520
We would have to write down
"scene of 1", "scene of 1.5",

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
if that's the two copies that we want
to have of our "scene", of our triangle.

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
And if you want to have ten copies of
the triangle, then you would have to ask

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,520
ten calls to this 'scene'
function which draws one triangle.

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,920
But that is not something you want
to do by hand, probably, right?

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,240
It is also not something that you
want to write down in the program:

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,840
ten times the same call, just
with different arguments.

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
What to do instead?

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,840
Let's think about imperative programming.

00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,800
What would we do?

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,240
That would probably take a for-loop.

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,400
We would say we want ten copies of
our call of the 'scene' function.

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,320
Then let's write a for-loop in which we use
the loop variable in such a way that we get

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
our ten copies of the triangle, for example.

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
But we don't have that, right?

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,040
That's something that I said from the
start, that we don't think in terms of

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,360
such control constructs, where we express
what to do, or express a repeated effect.

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,040
That wouldn't be expression-style.

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,280
It is not something that is available
in that way in a functional language.

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,080
We don't have this.

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
Well, then probably we
should have something else.

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,880
We want to be able to express this, of course.

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,840
So, what do we have instead?

37 # slide
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,280
What we have are the so-called
"list comprehensions", which

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
are our first kind of "rich
expressions" to consider.

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,680
And you see an example here.

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,080
You may also already have seen such
comprehensions in other programming languages,

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,440
but they originated in functional programming.

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
So, what do we have here?

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
We have our old 'scene' function in a sense.

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,840
So, it's the same thing.

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,040
I just rename the parameter from t to d,
because now it is not anymore about time,

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,040
but maybe about distance (so, where
I want to place my triangles).

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,400
So, this is unchanged from before, because
I still want to call this function.

00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,360
But then I use it differently.

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,680
Rather than passing it to an animationOf-call,

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,880
I instead pass it to a drawingOf-call,
but actually, I pass several copies.

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,560
And I do this in a list.

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,640
So, the square brackets here are for list syntax.

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
And in particular, I combined two things
here: I have some function 'pictures'.

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
It's given down here with its type.

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
So, what does it say?

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
It gives a picture and it
takes a list of pictures.

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,440
You might think it is a set of
pictures, but it is actually a list.

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,600
So, several pictures are turned into one picture.

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,840
You could think of the 'pictures' function

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,600
as a version of the &-operator, but now it
can work on arbitrarily many pictures at once.

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,920
Whereas the &-operator was a binary operator,
which basically combines two pictures.

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Here we have several pictures
that we combine into one.

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,391
And what are our pictures that
we want to combine into one?

00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,440
They are this expression here, which is
repeated here, a "list comprehension".

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,960
Because it comprehensively describes
several elements of the list at a time.

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,500
And how does it do that?

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,410
Well, it contains calls of the
'scene' function for some values.

00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,460
And these values are drawn from some other
list.

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,470
What it is saying, in a sense, precisely is:

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:27,479
Let the d variable be taken from 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, so six calls (basically six copies);

00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:34,170
and for each of these values, call the 'scene'
function, which will give one version of this moved

00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,830
triangle; put them all into a list; pass that
list of six pictures to the 'pictures' function,

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,300
which will turn them into one picture.

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,450
And that's the picture that we draw.

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:52,970
So, from this piece of code you should expect
six triangles at different places throughout

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,410
the space of our coordinate system.

00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:01,210
So, in some sense, of course,
this reminds us of a for-loop.

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,870
You could say this is a
for-loop, but it really isn't.

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,109
And that's important for several reasons.

00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:07,190
This is not a for-loop.

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,810
For example, there really
is not "one after another."

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:18,400
So, it is not like: first draw this; then
draw this; somehow put them into an order.

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,179
What comes out here is a list of values,
and these are completely independent.

00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:26,840
None of them is computed before or
after the other, mathematically.

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,510
Of course, on our sequential computer, they
will be evaluated in some order, but this

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,309
is completely irrelevant for the values.

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:37,410
Mathematically, it is just a list
of, in this case, six values.

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,669
And there is not a before- or after-notion,
which is, of course, the crucial notion for

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:42,669
a for-loop.

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,059
For a for-loop, you want to know whether
it will work backwards or forwards.

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,730
So, does it count up or down?

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,730
These all are things that are important for a
for-loop or any kind of loop in an imperative

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,839
language, but not for list comprehensions.

00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,690
So, these are independent computations.

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,169
There is also no effect, where somehow
one iteration influences the next one.

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:09,810
So, the scene-call for the value, let's say d = 1,
cannot have any effect on the "scene"-call

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,880
for the value d = 4, no matter whether
4 occurs after or before 1 in this list.

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,870
So, these are independent computations, whereas
in a for-loop, of course, you do expect (for

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:26,050
example, via global variables or local variables
that you assign values to) that the order

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,529
in which things happen in the loop is important,
and that the second run through the loop body

00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:36,860
could really have an impact on what happens
in the fifth or sixth or whatever iteration.

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,859
That's not something that happens here, because this
is really like a mathematical set comprehension.

00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:47,490
This notation that you know from mathematics:
Let me take the set of all "2 * n", where

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,070
n comes from the natural numbers.

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,760
This is what you should think of when
you think about a list comprehension.

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,500
It is also very close in
syntax, and that's by design.

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,609
So, you could think of this
as the "element symbol".

00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,890
So, d is an element of this list.

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,600
And for each such element, I
compute whatever is written here.

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,130
Then I get different pictures.

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,070
I put them into a list, just as
here they are put into a set.

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,880
And that list, like here this
set, is then what I pass on.

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,499
In this case, it is what is passed to the 'pictures'
function, in order to combine my different pictures

00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:27,490
into one big one, which is then drawn.

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,760
This is the way to think about a list comprehension,
not like a for-loop (where one thing happens

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,499
after another).

38 # slide
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:43,620
To further explain list comprehensions:
a few artificial examples.

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,409
Not about pictures, just
numbers, pairs of numbers, etc.

00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:55,499
Though, to start: something already shown on
the previous slide was a notation for simply

00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:56,790
having a list of values.

00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,320
There was this "0..5".

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,070
It was "all the numbers from 0 to 5".

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,710
Actually, this also comes in richer forms.

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:12,810
For example, one could get odd numbers by
starting with 1, 3.. and then an upper bound.

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,050
Then it would give all the
odd numbers up to that number.

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,089
So, in this case, where the last number is
10 (which is not an odd number), it would

00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,089
stop at 9.

00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:27,140
And this could be used as one of the lists, for
example, that you put into a list comprehension

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,770
(to draw values like d on the previous slide).

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,070
Generally, these list
comprehensions can have this form.

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,040
Here we can see the parts that
make up a list comprehension.

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
In general, we have:

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,100
The body, that's the thing that you want to
compute for any combination of values drawn

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,070
from the later parts.

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,440
So, that's what ends up in the final set.

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,070
Usually, this will contain some variable or
variables, which are bound in this later part

00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,869
of the list comprehension.

00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,920
And here we have generators.

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,310
Something like "x from this 1..10" would be a
generator, because it generates new elements

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,290
for which you compute the body.

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,160
And then, there also can be guards.

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,589
Some predicate, some condition.

00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,190
Basically, a Boolean value.

00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:21,420
You have not seen this yet, but there is a
function 'even' in Haskell, which takes a number

00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,730
and gives "true" if that number is
even; otherwise it gives "false".

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:31,869
So, what we are saying here is: For each x
from 1 to 10, check whether that number is

00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:32,869
even.

00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,489
That will be true for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:42,310
And then for any number drawn from this generator
which also passes this guard expression, the

00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,350
body will be computed.

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,830
And the results will be accumulated in the
list.

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,799
So, this will be square numbers of
all the even numbers between 1 and 10.

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,160
So: 2^2, 4^2, 6^2, 8^2, and 10^2.

00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,660
It gives these results.

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:05,700
Some other syntactic possibility is that inside
this list of things, like generators and guards,

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,570
we can also define local variables.

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,790
So let's say that we want to do something that
results in the same list, but in a different

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,950
way.

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,950
What we do here is:

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:23,929
Let x be anything from 1 to 10 (so this will
choose 1 to 10, one after the other, for x).

00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:28,080
Then, for each such x, we
compute some auxiliary value.

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,700
So, we compute y from the x that we have drawn
here, and then we give the guard expression

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
on the y.

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,589
So, what this is doing is that it takes all
the numbers from 1 to 10, computes the squares,

00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:43,630
and checks whether the
squares are divisible by 4.

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,440
Which, of course, ends up
with the same result as here.

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,260
Because this will be exactly the squares of
even numbers, because of course, the square

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,210
is divisible by 4 exactly if
the original number is even.

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,290
But it just happens in this case.

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,839
The point is that we can define
local values in between and use them.

00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,060
Another thing to notice in
this example is this "==".

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,670
This is the equality operator.

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,239
And it is really different from this.

00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:21,280
So, this is defining y to be x^2, and this
"==" is the operator which checks whether

00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:30,730
this call computing the modulo of y at
division by 4 is equal to the value 0.

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:38,760
Then we can have cases where we not only have
several guards, but also have several generators.

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,360
This happens here.

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,639
Instead of having just one variable, like here,
or one generator variable and one computed

00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:51,049
auxiliary variable, we can actually have two
variables which are drawn from generators.

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:57,339
So, here we are saying: Let's take x from [1, 2, 3]
and also y from [1, 2, 3] and then compute

00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:00,250
something like the product of x and y.

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:09,170
And then what we get are all the products
of a value from [1, 2, 3] and another value

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,410
from [1, 2, 3].

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:18,200
So, this 1 will be from multiplying 1 * 1,
and then we get all the other combinations

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,570
as well.

39 # slide
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:29,250
Once you have more than one variable in the
body of a list comprehension, the question

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,729
becomes: In which order are the
things combined into a result list?

00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:40,109
In the previous example with the multiplication,
that was not obvious from the result, because

00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,380
we can't see which factors were combined.

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,030
But, for example, if you consider this example:

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:50,741
The x comes from [1, 2, 3] and y from [4,
5], and we build the pair of the values x

00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:57,099
and y (maybe as coordinates); then we see
in the result how things are arranged.

00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:03,289
You see that first the x from [1, 2, 3] is
picked as 1, and then this is combined with

00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,229
each possible choice for the y from [4, 5].

00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:07,900
So, we have (1, 4) and (1, 5).

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,880
And then we get all combinations where x has
chosen the second element of its generator

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,159
and this is combined with y being 4
and 5 in these two elements, and so on.

00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,410
So, we get this list of results.

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:28,240
This is, of course, the Cartesian product
of these two lists considered as sets.

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,880
And the order in which it is output is by
first making a choice for x, and then all

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,550
possible choices for y, and then
taking the next choice for x, etc.

00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:47,550
This also means that if you change the order
of such generators, you get the same values,

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,730
but possibly in a different order.

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,130
So, take the same body, but switch the order
of these generators; then the resulting list

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,210
has a slightly different order.

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,510
Because now first the y is chosen, and then
for each valid choice for y, for example for

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,909
the choice "y is 4", we
consider all choices for the x.

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:09,190
So, we get (1,4), (2,4), (3,4).

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:15,760
And if there was another variable here, like
z, then that should be either known from the

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,110
context, or somehow from the part of the program
in which this expression occurs, or the z

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,800
should be set by another generator here.

00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,190
So, we can't have variables that are not known
at all, either from the context or from this

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,440
list of generators.

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,080
This can also become more interesting.

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,300
The generators themselves
can depend on each other.

00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,979
Or more precisely, a later generator list
can depend on something which is occurring

00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,610
earlier in the list of generators/guards.

00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:57,080
So, what this is saying, is: I want to have
all the pairs x and y where x comes from [1,

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,130
2, 3] and y comes from [1 .. x] (1 to x).

00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,150
So for the choice "x is 1", then for y we
also have the choice "1", because [1 .. 1]

00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,229
(1 to 1) is just [1].

00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:08,120
So, we only get (1,1).

00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,219
But for the choice "x is 2", we
get that y is chosen from 1 to 2.

00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:13,229
So, we get (2,1) and (2,2).

00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:19,820
And for "3", we get (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), because
for a different x we have different choices,

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,070
because we have different lists in this place.

00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,290
It wouldn't work the other way around.

00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,250
We couldn't mention y here, if y
occurs as a later generator variable.

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:38,410
Of course, you could use y at this place,
because y is the first generator variable

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,440
here.

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,300
And this can become interesting
also in different ways.

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:49,260
For example, you could also decide
to actually pick x and y at once.

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,039
For this, we actually have to
have a list of pairs here.

00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:56,210
So, you also see here: It doesn't just work
for numbers (actually, we have seen it before

00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,649
in the context of pictures), but it also
works for other datatypes in Haskell.

00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:00,979
So, let's say we take strings.

00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:05,490
If you have a list of pairs of strings, then
we could also have a generator expression

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:12,580
which says "let me pick all the
(x,y) pairs from this list".

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,250
And then, of course, we wouldn't get a Cartesian
product as above (where every choice for

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,070
this is combined with every choice for that).

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,880
Now here, what we say, is: The first
choices x and y are this and this.

00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,779
And then we collect their concatenation.

00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,779
That's what this symbol does.

00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,330
So, we concatenate "a" and "b",
which gives the string "ab".

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,080
And the next choice is not somehow "a" with
"c".

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,960
Instead, the next choice is really: We apply
this pair pattern and get its ingredients

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,479
from the next pair of the generator list.

00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:44,779
So, the next choice would
be: x is "c" and y is "d".

00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:49,870
So, the next thing to be computed here
would be the string "cd", and that's it.

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,979
No crosswise comparison,
because here we bind x and y.

00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:57,570
We choose x and y at once from all these pairs.

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,940
Whereas here, we had independent
choices for the x and for the y.

00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,260
That's why we get more results up here.

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,180
Here, we use this matching against the pair.

00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:14,390
That's also something that often would be
written down in mathematical set notation.

40 # slide
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:24,339
Taking a step back again, let's ask where
we are now, concerning expressiveness.

00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:27,289
Some take-home messages from
the examples we have seen:

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:31,860
We can now via a function
express non-constant behavior.

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,720
So, functions in the mathematical sense.

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,450
No weird keywords for imperative
behavior, no loops, just pure expressions.

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:47,690
Such a description, like for our
animations, defines behavior as a whole.

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,210
So, not in a piecemeal fashion.

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:55,420
That is not really a concept of "run this
piece of animation, then that piece, and then

00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
something else".

00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:04,409
That was not something that happens in such
a description of an animation in terms of

00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,450
mathematical functions.

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,659
Indeed, there is not even a concept of "this
piece of animation stops at some point".

00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:14,120
We didn't say "use this from 0 to
10 seconds" or something like that.

00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,289
We said: f(t) is something, namely an expression
which describes a picture, in which a t might

00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:21,289
occur.

00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:27,360
And that then is an ever-running animation.

00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,219
It does this for increasing
t however long this may be.

00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,660
There is no end point.

00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,890
Of course, this doesn't mean that we don't want
to express possibly non-continuous behavior.

00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:48,890
You might want to run an animation just for
some time, or switch from some function to

00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:54,130
another function (from some animation to another
animation), based on some condition about

00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,909
time (for example, time intervals).

00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:00,580
But we are not going to do this by
resorting to sequential commands.

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:05,650
We are not going to use imperative keywords,
or semicolons for composition in a sequential

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,650
way.

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,479
Like saying: "this animation
and then that animation."

00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:15,670
That would be too big a deviation from the
mathematical idea of expressing functions.

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,250
So, we need something else.

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,210
Unfortunately, list comprehensions
are not the answer either.

00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:30,250
We just introduced them in the last examples
for avoiding duplication of expressions.

00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,599
For example, for expressing
this discrete distribution.

00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,820
But it's not something that
is used to define functions.

00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,080
List comprehensions define values.

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,870
They are list values, but they are values.

00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:49,000
So, they are not defining, for example, an
animation which consists of several pieces.

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,159
So, we need something else.

00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:58,340
And actually, some keywords which
are used inside expressions.

41 # slide
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,479
What we need is some way to express conditionals.

00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:08,460
And this is done, as in probably almost all
programming languages that you know, by "if-then"

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
or "if-then-else".

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,780
Actually here, by "if-then-else".

00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,469
So let's look at an example.

00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:14,800
The "if", "then", and "else"
are, of course, keywords.

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,019
But they are used inside expressions.

00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:19,110
So let's consider these examples.

00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,920
This example scene is, again, an
animation; because: from time to something.

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,479
And what does it say?

00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:29,459
It makes a check on the time,
whether it is smaller than 3 or not.

00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:34,349
And if so, then it computes this
expression, which depends on t.

00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:40,390
And if you look at it a bit, you will see
that it will basically animate a moving circle

00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:46,930
which moves somehow diagonally (because x and
y will always have the same value, namely

00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,530
the current time in seconds).

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,670
So, this will be a small circle that from
the origin moves in a diagonal fashion here.

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,349
But it does so only until t becomes 3.

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:02,520
Because when t is 3 plus something, then this
"if-then-else" will actually mean that the

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,310
"then" branch is not important and the
"else" branch will be the relevant one.

00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,590
What do we have there?

00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,590
What is "blank"?

00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,590
This "blank" is a picture.

00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,520
It's a predefined picture which shows nothing.

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,750
It's an empty picture.

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,740
Which you might consider to
be a stupid picture to have.

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,370
But actually here in this case, that is a
nice way to express that after three seconds

00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,290
our animation shouldn't show anything anymore.

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,770
So, it will show the empty
picture, namely nothing.

00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:36,860
Now, this notation here (this way of expressing
things) is similar to and reminds one of conditionals

00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,650
in mathematics.

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:44,590
These are keywords in Haskell, but they are
just ways of organizing an expression, actually

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,260
organizing several cases of expressions.

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:53,000
Mathematically, they are functions like f(x)
is: If x is more than zero (or some other

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,290
property), then this expression;
otherwise this expression.

00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,250
And it will always evaluate to one of them.

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,770
It won't evaluate to both of
them, nor to one after the other.

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,510
It's a pure expression
depending on the value of x.

00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,010
This is what we evaluate, or this.

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:14,620
And the same happens up here.

42 # slide
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:20,580
We can also compare the situation to
other languages you know, like C or Java.

00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:27,610
There you also have an "if"
construct and an "if-else" construct.

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,780
So, this is the syntax for C or Java.

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,490
There are, of course, some syntactical
differences to what we've just seen.

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,130
But actually, the more important difference
is that we even have these two versions: just

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,920
an "if" or an "if-else".

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,400
Whereas in an expression language, the form
without the "else" does not make any sense.

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,750
So in Haskell we always have,
and must have, if-then-else.

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,250
Because we have a condition here, and
either this condition is true or false.

00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,410
And even if it is false, we must have some
value.

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,410
That's different here.

00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,410
Why is it different?

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,740
Because in C or Java we are writing commands,
and it's meaningful to say: there is no command.

00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,090
You can say: If something holds, then do all
these commands, and otherwise don't do anything.

00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,640
That's a reasonable thing to say in a command-based
language, where you have commands that execute.

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,770
Then you can say: Well, in
some cases I don't do anything.

00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,770
That's fine.

00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:21,010
But in a mathematical/expression-based
language, you must have some value.

00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,050
Everything must evaluate to some value, and
you cannot say: under certain conditions,

00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,330
I don't evaluate to anything.

00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,590
You have to have some value.

00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,750
So, you cannot have an "if-then"
without the "else" branch.

00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,110
Because you have to compute a value.

00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,150
Whereas here, you say you do some things,
and in some cases you don't do anything.

00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,150
That's fine.

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,240
That is some action.

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,810
It will be a no-action, but
there is no value required.

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:49,960
So actually, the "if-then-else" in Haskell
is not really so similar to "if-else", as

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,480
keywords, in C or Java.

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,860
It's actually more similar to this
conditional operator in those languages.

00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:02,100
Which is also something that in C or Java
you use on the expression level; not with

00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,800
commands (here, here, and here),
but actually with expressions.

00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,250
This is something that could occur in an expression
on the right-hand side of a variable assignment,

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:17,080
whereas something like this cannot occur in C
or Java on the right-hand side of a variable

00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
assignment.

00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,310
Because it is about commands,
and not about expressions.

00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:30,000
It is also a bit strange that you have two
ways of expressing conditionals in C and Java.

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,640
But that's because you have these two levels: you
have the commands and you have the expressions.

00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,040
And in a language where you have only expressions
(where everything is expression-based), you

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,620
have only one of these forms.

00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:47,370
This also means, for example, that in Haskell (with
all of this talk about syntactic compositionality

00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,840
I already mentioned) you can name
arbitrary parts of these expressions.

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,080
You can name the expression as a whole.

00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,020
You can put an "if-then-else" as an
expression inside a function call.

00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,230
You can name parts of it.

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:04,270
Whereas for example here, you
cannot name this part of an "if".

00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:09,880
That's the discussion I had in an earlier
video about expressions versus commands in

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,480
terms of naming subparts of a program.

00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,760
Which is easily possible here, but not in
the command-based setting, which is where

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,910
the "if" and "if-else" of Java live in.

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,260
It's a bit different for this,
because it's expression-based.

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,570
But well, in Haskell
everything is expression-based.

43 # slide
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:36,630
For the if-then-else in the earlier example, we
somehow intuitively want an "if-then" without

00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,630
an "else".

00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,780
Which we cannot have.

00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,580
Then there must be some neutral
value in an algebraic sense.

00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:49,040
So, there cannot be no value, but of course,
there are certain values that correspond to

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
"nothing".

00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,260
Like in the picture case: the "blank"
is something like "no picture".

00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
But it is a picture.

00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,450
It's an empty picture.

00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,450
It's a neutral value.

00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,310
It's not "no value".

00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,940
And the same is true for many types.

00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,710
So let's say we have the same
situation in a list context.

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,800
We want to say: If a condition is true, then
we have some non-empty list, and otherwise

00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,890
there isn't really anything.

00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,360
But there isn't nothing; there is the empty
list.

00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,830
So, we can use the empty list, because the
empty list is algebraically a neutral value

00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,330
in the type of lists.

00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:25,390
That is an observation that will probably be
useful for at least one of the next exercise

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,840
tasks.

00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,570
And then there's another thing which I also
mentioned already on the previous slide, and

00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,660
with which I want to finish this video now.

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:41,570
It is this remark that "if-then-else" is an
expression, so it can be part of a larger

00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,570
expression.

00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,850
You can name its parts, itself, etc.

00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:52,130
So, what I want to emphasize here is really
this point of not hesitating, of really freely

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,460
using "if-then-else" as
part of other expressions.

00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:02,350
I have observed many times in the past that
students somehow are concerned or hesitant

00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:07,260
to write something like this, where the "if-then-else"
is not somehow on the top-level (as you are

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,240
probably used to from other languages like
C or Java, where you can't really have this

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,960
inside some expression; you always have the
"if-then" as keywords on the outside, on the

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
top-level).

00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,610
But there's no reason for this hesitation
in an expression-based language.

00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:27,910
So, you can have something like this: f is
a function which takes three arguments, and

00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,590
maybe x and y are the first two arguments,
and the last argument actually depends on

00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,590
some condition.

00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,150
You can write something like "if", "condition"
(expression), "then" some picture, some other

00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,840
picture (or whatever is the type here).

00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,960
The meaning of this is the same as below.

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,740
So, it is the same as if you would say: if
the condition is true, then you want to apply

00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,640
f to x and y and this first expression; otherwise
you want to apply f to x and y and the last

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
expression.

00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,030
So of course, you can write this and often
students at this stage do write this code

00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,030
like this.

00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:05,180
But actually, this code is expressing the
same, and it's actually nicer because it avoids

00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,180
repetition.

00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,650
It is more explicitly expressing that in any
case, you will apply f to x and y, and you

00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,880
only still have to decide whether
the last argument is exp2 or exp3.

00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,720
This is perfectly expressed in the first line,
and somewhat hidden (and takes more checking)

00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,150
in the last line.

00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:29,190
So in that sense, in situations like this,
I would prefer the first line, because it's

00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,420
more clearly expressing what's going on.

00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:37,070
But for this, you have to accept that "if-then-else"
is just an expression that can be used as

00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:45,240
subexpression of whatever: other
expressions, function calls, etc.

44 # slide
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,550
Okay, I have to correct myself.

00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:53,220
I actually didn't yet want to close the video.

00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,570
I actually want to make a few more remarks on
syntax and types, and also syntax of types.

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:04,580
So, I actually announced this earlier in the
video that I have something to say on this,

00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,300
also probably for your next exercise tasks.

00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,550
Let's do this and then finish.

45 # slide
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:20,760
Earlier, I showed this and claimed that these
were the types of some of the primitives you

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,990
have seen and have been using.

00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,220
And I said that this is like mathematical
notation, like the Cartesian product.

00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:33,740
For example, for a three-argument function
like "translated", I said that there is this

00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:38,450
Cartesian product of twice the real
numbers, and then the Picture type.

00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,300
And I also said: This is not exactly what
you see if you look up the definitions of

00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
these functions.

00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,440
And indeed, what you instead will see is something
like that, also when you look into the online

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,440
documentation.

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,540
But this is really just, for certain reasons,
a different way of writing things down.

00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,930
For example, if let's look
at the "translated" function.

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,220
It's a function with three arguments
and whose result is Picture.

00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:10,570
Then how it's actually written as a type in
Haskell, is this notation, where even before

00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,350
the first few arguments you
also have this arrow symbol.

00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:19,930
So instead of having these three arguments
somehow denoted by having these two Cartesian

00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:24,200
products here, and then the function arrow
to the result, actually the way it's written

00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,430
is: first argument type, arrow, second argument
type, arrow, third argument type, and then

00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,940
the result type.

00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,920
Other than that, and of course switching from
this mathematical symbol for the real numbers

00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,800
to the actual type "Double" in
Haskell, that's equivalent to up here.

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,370
And all the other types are
also likewise and similar.

00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,800
Here, inside the list, there
is also a different thing.

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,500
So, you really want a list of pairs.

00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:56,911
It is not a function like here, where you
say: turn this three-argument function into

00:46:56,911 --> 00:47:01,650
a notation like this, where we
always have the function arrow.

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,770
This would not make sense here,
because this is really a set of pairs.

00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:10,240
And then the notation in Haskell simply is
not with the cross for the Cartesian product,

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,360
but actually also at the type
level you simply write pairs.

00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:21,120
So, this is the type of
pairs of Doubles and Doubles.

46 # slide
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:27,930
Then, in terms of syntax on the expression—
rather than type-level, I have already earlier

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,250
(in one of the example videos) commented at
some length on this difference between the

00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,700
mathematical notation and the function notation.

00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:40,520
So, this shouldn't be news to you at this point,
that we write in this form without that many

00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,200
brackets or commas.

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,970
For nested function application, of
course, we do need brackets sometimes.

00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:52,360
For example, where an f call occurs as an
argument in the position of the g call, then

00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,590
we can't avoid these brackets.

00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,840
Because that wouldn't be clear, who calls
what.

00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,110
But this is how we would then express that
this together is the second argument of this

00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,110
g call.

00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:11,300
We have also seen something like this already
in more complex expressions with "rotated"

00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,300
and "colored" and whatever.

00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:18,320
The same syntax as this one in particular,
where function application is with spaces

00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,830
and without commas, is what is
used at function definition sites.

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:27,770
Again, you have seen this at least for "scene
t = something" (scene of t is something).

00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,200
And it also applies if we have
functions with more than one argument.

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,000
So, something which in Java or C would look
like so: We declare that f is a function which

00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,770
takes an integer and a
character and returns a float.

00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:47,960
This would in Haskell turn into this more
mathematical way of writing down the types.

00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,790
So, integer and character are the two
argument types, and float is the return type.

00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:57,490
There are of course syntax differences like
that these types are written in uppercase.

00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:03,180
But that of course is just how the
language works on the lexical level.

00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,200
And then, naming the function: where here
the function is named in the type, and in

00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,790
the definition it's named again.

00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:16,390
We have f of "a" and "b" not in brackets and
commas, etc., but simply "f a b =" and then

00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:19,320
we have the body of the function definition.

00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,660
Of course, there are differences as well,
like that in the Java code here we would have

00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,660
commands and we might not even have a return
from this call, because a function in Java

00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,810
need not return something.

00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,060
Well, here it would return a float,
but you could have "void", for example.

00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,460
And then maybe the function
doesn't return anything.

00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,290
So, it is not really a mathematical function.

00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,510
In contrast, in Haskell, of course,
there has to be some expression here.

00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:49,080
So, there must always come a float out of a
call of f on a and b (on some values, some

00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,080
arguments).

00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,890
And also there are differences like
the semantics of these local variables.

00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:00,250
What they do is different in Haskell
from these imperative languages.

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,650
Here you could have assignments,
where you overwrite a and b.

00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:09,830
Here a and b are inputs and they can be used
on the right-hand side, but they cannot be

00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:10,830
changed.

00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:17,800
So, the role of variables is different, which
you already know from previous examples, of

00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,140
course.

47 # slide
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,590
Then there is an issue of
whitespace and layout in Haskell.

00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:28,640
Haskell is a layout-sensitive language, which
means that if you group things like local

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,780
definitions, then the
horizontal layout is important.

00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:40,670
The layout in the sense: in
which column things start.

00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,670
What does this mean?

00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,200
Let's consider "let" and "in".

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,490
This is another way to
organize local definitions.

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,820
We already saw something like: "f x is something,
where ..." and then we had some local definitions.

00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:57,240
Where the things that are locally defined
are mentioned after the main expression.

00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,910
We can also have it the other way around, but
then we don't use "where" but rather "let-in".

00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:07,410
So, what this is saying here is: We want to
compute the expression f c + f d, and inside

00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,570
there we want to use some things,
for example, the y and the f.

00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,740
Actually, y is used here, and f is
a function which will be used here.

00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,280
So, it is not a top-level function which occurs
somewhere else in the program, but it's local

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,610
to this expression.

00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:24,900
And then we say "let something and something in"
and then we use what we have defined before.

00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,710
Differently than in the "where" case, where
we have mentioned the local definitions after

00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,710
the expression in which they are used.

00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,920
This is something that you can write down.

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,360
And it's important that these things
start in the same column here.

00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,780
So in that sense, the layout (how
far you indent things) is important.

00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:50,590
We could also avoid this
and write explicit grouping.

00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:55,720
So, this is also valid in
Haskell, where I don't use layout.

00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:02,830
I simply say: I want to group these two definitions,
and then we actually use semicolons and these

00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,830
curly brackets.

00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,770
And this is equivalent.

00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:10,330
Then we don't have to be careful about the
layout, because these curly brackets and the

00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,060
semicolon explain what the grouping is.

00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:21,390
But if you don't use this, then you have to be
careful of the layout, as in other layout-sensitive

00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,720
languages like Python (which came after).

00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:29,140
This also means that, for example, these
two pieces of program are not accepted.

00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:35,420
They would be rejected or not mean what you
think they mean, because the layout cannot

00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,050
be used to group things.

00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:43,100
Which also means that if you write Haskell
code, then you should prefer an editor in

00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:48,890
which you can ensure that indenting
via spaces and via tabs is not mixed.

00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:54,980
You should usually use spaces instead of tab
characters, because the compiler cannot, by

00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:02,940
default, know what indentation level a
tab symbol corresponds to in your editor.

00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,290
So, things might look okay to you when you look
in your editor, but actually what a compiler

00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,350
sees is something like that.

00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:17,920
So, that's a typical trap to fall into if
you haven't programmed in a layout-sensitive

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,800
language before.

48 # slide
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,370
And now really finally for this video, let
me conclude by talking again about brackets,

00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,930
basically, and writing expressions.

00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:38,330
I mentioned already that we use fewer brackets
than you might expect if you haven't programmed

00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,010
in a language with this
kind of syntax rules before.

00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:46,350
So, for example, we don't need to bracket
the x argument in a call like this because

00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:50,880
this expression is just the
same and is uniquely parsable.

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,910
So, it's clear what this means.

00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,470
We don't need extra brackets here.

00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:58,610
And similarly, in calls like this, we don't
need brackets around these two function calls

00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,010
whose results are added.

00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:07,090
Because this function application (basically this
space here) binds tighter than all operators.

00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:12,560
So, it is not necessary to say that you
want (f x) and then add this to (g y).

00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,040
Actually, even if you write it like that,
the parser will consider this as one unit

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,240
which is added to this other expression.

00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,140
So, this is one thing.

00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:28,200
And we have already mentioned that Autotool
will also warn you about redundant brackets

00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,800
and encourage you to remove them.

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,280
Then there is another thing that students
sometimes do if they have read Haskell example

00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,430
code at other places or on the internet.

00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:43,980
So, there is this possibility to save even
more brackets by using the dollar-operator.

00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:51,400
Which would allow, for example, to avoid all
brackets in this expression by writing something

00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,560
like that.

00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,950
But I have to say I don't like the dollar-operator,
in particular in beginners' code, because

00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:03,570
it gets easily misused or used in a way
that doesn't really improve readability.

00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:09,540
So actually, again, Autotool will discourage
or even forbid the use of the dollar-operator.

00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:14,040
But I wanted to mention it at least, because
I know that some students read about it in

00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,610
other places and then maybe are wondering why
they cannot use it in their exercise submissions.

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:25,620
That's basically because I am the dictator
here, and I prefer not to let you use this

00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,920
too early, at least.

00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,780
For more advanced Haskell programmers, this can
be an important function to use in structuring

00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,160
their code, but not for you,
I would say at this point.

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:43,360
And as mentioned, sometimes Autotool gives
warnings about things like redundant brackets

00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,910
or even overuse of this dollar-symbol.

00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,680
And sometimes these are not just
warnings, but they are really enforced.

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,430
So, you will always have to read the feedback.

00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,940
And if the feedback is red, then you know
that you really have to change something,

00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,860
because you're not yet meeting the criteria.

00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:05,020
Be it correctness, or be it style criteria
like the ones mentioned here and others later

00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,520
on.
