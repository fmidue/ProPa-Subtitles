79 # slide
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,720
So, let us look at a more
complicated example now.

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,400
The program from earlier
involving multiplication.

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,640
And it will be an example where we

00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,760
will immediately, after a few steps,
see some infinite search going on.

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,600
And that happens even for simpler queries
than the ones on the previous slides,

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,400
a few slides back where we had multiplication
of n and m and then a larger term here.

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,240
It turns out that even if we just
asked for multiplication of two

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,720
values, which should result in
1, we do get an infinite search.

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,320
Even though there is one obvious
solution, Prolog will not find this,

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,400
will not discover this.

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,320
And we will use this for

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,720
visualizing, illustrating the derivation
trees again, in a more complex setting.

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,560
And we will find why this
infinite search happens.

00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,060
Okay.

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
So, let's see, how do we start?

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,360
With the intuitive explanation
of derivation trees.

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,000
What should we do?

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, we should see whether this query that we
have, and actually, the first literal in the

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
query, which is the only literal, whether it
unifies with the head of any program clause.

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,600
Of course, the additional
clauses are not relevant here.

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,160
We only have to look at
the multiplication clauses.

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,840
And actually, the first one does not

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
unify because at the last position
we have 0 here and s(0) here.

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,000
There is no positive match,
no unification going on.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,960
So, actually, the only choice is to unify
the second program clause for multiplication.

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
So, the last clause from the program.

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Okay?

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,280
Is this unifiable?

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
Yes, indeed it is.

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Well, you can see, you could replace n by
s(x), M by Y or Y by M, and Z by s(0).

00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,800
And then we have a unifier.

00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,640
Okay, that's exactly what we do.

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,840
And actually, in the first step I avoid
adding a number to all the variables.

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
I will do this in the later steps.

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,000
So, for now, since N and M and X, Y, Z are
(different), there's no danger of confusion.

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Also, the u here doesn't occur in the query.

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
There is no need in the
first step to name anything.

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Later on, I will do it.

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
Okay, so simple unification,
then what is the next query?

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
Well, it's the right-hand side of this clause.

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Because this literal will be replaced by
the right-hand side from the program clause.

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,360
But of course, with this substitution applied.

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
And if you take a sharp look, we see that, well,

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
n and m don't even occur on
the right-hand side here.

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
So, the only thing that needs to
be replaced is Z which occurs here.

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Must be replaced by s(0).

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Okay, so the next query is this one.

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
The right-hand side of this
clause with z replaced by s(0).

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Okay, next goal is to look at this.

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,920
Now we have, for the first time, in
an example, two literals in our query.

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,920
And in the verbal description,
I said that we always

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
select the leftmost literal and
look for resolution opportunities.

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,360
So, we will have to take a look at this.

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,640
We don't look at the addition, we
look at this multiplication literal.

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,200
And try to unify it with the
head of some program clause.

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
Of course, the addition
clauses are, again, irrelevant.

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,120
And from these two clauses now, actually, we
can't exclude one because both could be unified.

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,240
The situation was different in the first
step because we had this s(0) here, which

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,160
clearly didn't unify with the 0.

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,120
But now since we have mult(X, Y, U) so
three variables there's a good chance that

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,480
we can actually unify with both heads with the
fact and with the head of this second clause.

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
Indeed, that is the case.

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,520
Okay, in which order do we do this?

00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,200
Well, top to bottom.

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,040
So, we look at the first clause from the program.

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,800
That's the first successor
that we build for this query.

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
Okay, so what is the unifier there?

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Well, this X becomes 0, this Y becomes
the underscore, the anonymous variable.

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
And actually, to be on the safe side, we
also introduced numbers for these variables.

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
Because they might be relevant.

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,000
I mean, they are not relevant in the sense of
being shown to the user as an outcome in the end.

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
But they will occur in the substitution.

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,240
So, we should be able to distinguish them in
case there are several underscore variables.

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,480
Okay, so they get a number of these are also

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,840
similar to the artificial variable name that you
sometimes get when Prolog gives you an answer.

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay, that's why we have the _1 here and
the U from the query is replaced by 0.

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
Yes, that's the most general unifier between this

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
literal and the first clause here,
the head of the first clause.

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
Okay, and there will be another successor,

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,640
because actually this also unifies with the
head of the second multiplication clause.

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,840
But we will look at this after
we have finished this branch.

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
Okay, so what is the next query here?

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,960
Well, we have to replace literals
that we used for resolution

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,760
by the right-hand side of the relevant clause.

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,840
This is the empty right-hand side.

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
So, we will replace this by empty.

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,440
But unlike in the previous example, this doesn't
mean that the query is now already finished.

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
Because there was some context, right?

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
So, previously, when we used a fact, we
were done, we could draw the box because

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
we had arrived at the empty query.

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,200
But that was only because previously we
always had only one literal in the query.

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,720
Now, when we replace this by empty,
we are still not at the empty query.

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Because there is this other
literal still around in the query.

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,880
And we cannot simply use this
literal as the next query,

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,040
because we also have to apply
the unifier to all the context.

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,720
So, actually, the next literal will
be this literal but with X, Y, and U

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,840
replaced according to the substitution.

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
So, that's where we end up.

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,680
X well, is not occurring, but
U should be replaced by 0.

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
So, you have 0 here.

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
The Y is replaced by this
specific anonymous variable.

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
And well, the s(0) is still what it was.

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,340
Yeah.

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Okay, so this is the next
thing you want to work on.

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,720
Because among all the unfinished queries, also the
one that would appear here, after this step with

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,720
the second multiplication clause, we always use
the leftmost one as the next thing to consider.

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
So, that's where we have to make progress.

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,160
So, we have to try unifying this with
all the clauses from the program.

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
Of course, it can only unify
with the addition clauses.

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
And actually, it doesn't unify
with the second addition clause.

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,000
Because of the s(something) versus 0 here.

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,680
So, actually, there will be only one successor
here, namely, the one that arises from resolution

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,760
of this literal with the fact
from the addition clauses here.

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,720
Okay, so 0 and 0 unifies X, and X
should be replaced by some variable.

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
Maybe X2 or X3 or something like that.

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,160
But then they are unified with what we see here.

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:39,520
So, actually, I replace this by X1, X1
and then I can unify X1 becomes a 0.

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,320
This _1 then also must be s(0),
and 0 and 0 already match.

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,600
So, that's the next unifier.

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,960
So, I use X1, X1 here because I
didn't rename the earlier occurrences.

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Okay, then this is replaced by the
right-hand side, which is empty.

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,040
So, actually, we arrive at the empty query now.

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
And what are the solutions?

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,120
Well, let's see N becomes s(X), X becomes 0.

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,400
So, ultimately, N will be s(0),
and M becomes Y, Y becomes _1,

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,480
and _1 becomes s(0).

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,560
So, ultimately, we have this result one
times one is one, which makes perfect sense.

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,960
We have found a solution.

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Okay, but we are not done yet.

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,480
Because Prolog will be instructed
now to look for further solutions.

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,040
And there is one place here, where we
didn't yet consider what happens, right?

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,960
So, this multiplication literal also unifies with
the second program clause for multiplication.

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,960
In which way?

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,440
Well, let's now replace this X, Y,
Z, et cetera, by X2, Y1, et cetera.

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,680
And then unify with this multiplication literal
from the query, then, what do we have to do?

00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,600
Well, this X should be s(X2), this Y should be Y2,
and this Y will simply be unified, and well, there

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,400
we have Z2 and U and again, it doesn't really
matter whether we replace Z2 by U or U by Z2.

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,880
In each case, you will get
a most general unifier.

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
So, let's choose this one.

00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:23,200
The most important thing is that the X from
the literal and the query is replaced by s(X2),

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,480
because that's what this place looks like
after a consistent renaming of variable names.

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, what's the next query?

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
Well, the rule is we have to replace
this literal by the right-hand side

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
of the clause that we used for resolution.

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,360
So, we will replace this one
literal by these two literals.

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,760
But, of course, with the substitution applied.

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,960
Which in particular will replace
this U and this U by Z2.

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,840
Okay.

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,080
Well, not exactly, actually.

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
I already got confused a bit myself.

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,400
So, let me take back this last thing.

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,320
So, we replace this by the right-hand side.

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,480
But of course, this U and this U are not that
U because I renamed the variables in the query.

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,880
So, I will get mult(X2,Y2,U2),
add(U2,Y2,Z2).

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
And in addition, I get what
remained from the previous query.

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,240
This part, which wasn't replaced by the
resolution step, and due to these two

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,840
substitution pieces, I have
to change to Z2 and Y2.

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,480
So, overall, I get this as the next query,

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,640
which already looks problematic
because it's larger than this one.

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,840
And it's not clear whether at any time you
will be able to reduce this to an empty query.

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,600
Okay, but at the moment, that's simply
what results from this resolution step.

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay, let's go on.

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,560
Strategy is we look at the leftmost
literal, which is this one,

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,720
and we check whether it is unified with
any heads of clauses from the program.

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,960
Okay, now, again, since these are just variables,

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,640
there's a good chance that it is
unifiable with both of these heads.

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,160
And that is the case.

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,660
Yes.

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,960
So, for example, we have 0, something, 0.
We can clearly unify this.

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,800
And now for this underscore, I use _2 to
make sure that I don't get any confusion.

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,520
Then I unify this and, well, that
is a unifier that unifies those.

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,680
But there's also another successor because

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,120
this actually also unifies with
the head of the second clause.

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,680
But let's focus on this here first.

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,480
What will happen, well, we replace this by the
right-hand side of this fact, which is empty.

00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
So, this will disappear.

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,280
And for the remaining literals, we have to
apply the substitution that we discovered here.

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,520
Okay, doing this will result in this next query.

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Okay, and actually, I will not continue this

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,440
search here so there will be
further steps happening down here.

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,640
Okay, but actually, if you look
at this query very sharply,

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,080
you will already see that certainly there won't
be a solution arising from this subtree here.

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,560
Because what that solution would amount to
would be some choices for these two variables

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,120
such that 0 plus this thing is this thing.

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
Of course, this can only mathematically
be true if these two values are the same.

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,280
But then there's also another literal which claims
that this summation of these two should be one.

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,520
That can't be true, right?

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,280
There can't be any substitution
for these two variables such that

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,440
both hold that 0 plus this is
this, but also this plus this is 1.

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,240
Because this will be the same value.

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
They can't add up to one.

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
Okay, so there will not be
any solution found here.

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,160
So, actually, the query will ultimately
have to look at this branch as well.

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Now, what is this branch?

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,880
Well, it arises from unifying this literal with
the head of the second multiplication clause.

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
And we will, again, rename variables here.

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,080
So, this becomes X3, Y3, Z3, et cetera.

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,840
And if we do this, we can
actually find a unifier.

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,760
And we get a new query.

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,840
And this will again have further
possibilities to apply steps.

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,760
And at this point, I think it becomes clear that
this is not a good process that's happening here.

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
Because this will grow ever
larger and larger, right?

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
So, here we have one multiplication
literal and one addition literal.

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,240
Then we use this rule to resolve, but that led
to one multiplication and two addition literals.

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,640
And actually, in this place, we already have
one multiplication and three addition literals.

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Because we always have variables here.

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,600
So, we can always apply the
second multiplication rule.

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,600
So, this will only get longer and longer and
it will never actually finish the whole tree.

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
So, that's why we have an infinite search here.

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
We find one solution.

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
But afterwards, Prolog
looks for further solutions.

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,960
It will never find one, but will also never
finish its process of looking for them.

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,160
Okay, so we have to do something
to make this program work better.

80 # slide
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:43,840
One thing we could try to do is to change the
order of literals in the last program clause here.

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,520
Yes, if the problem is that we have
this infinite descent where we always

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,640
replicate a multiplication literal
and add an addition literal.

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,080
But we never get to actually check
these because the multiplication

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,240
is always the first thing to select in
all these steps on the previous slide.

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,920
Then maybe it's better to simply
switch the order of these literals.

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
So, logically from the logical reading
and also from the declarative semantics of

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
the program, that doesn't make any change, right?

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
So, it's still the same statement.

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
Because conjunction is commutative.

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
But the search process might be changed by this.

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,080
Because by moving this addition to the front, this
will be first explored during the search process.

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,560
And that could mean that some of these
infinite branches are actually cut off.

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,480
Because we fail to find a
solution for this addition.

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,240
And then we can say that whole part of this
search tree does not need to be explored.

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,680
Unlike the case where we have this multiplication
here as the first successor literal.

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
And we never get to actually
check these additions.

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,840
Okay, so let's try this.

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,440
And let's simply see what happens
if we do this for the same query.

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
Okay, so of course, in the beginning,
what happens is very similar, right?

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,600
So, in the first step, again,
we cannot apply this fact.

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
So, we have only one successor
which will be this one.

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,520
So, the unifier is as before.

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,680
But of course, now the order of literals
in the next query is different, right?

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,760
So, that's like the previous example.

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,440
But now, of course, the order of these
two is exactly the opposite way around.

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay.

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,400
Now, since you always select the
first literal from the query,

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,600
we will look at this instead
of the multiplication.

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
So, let's look at this.

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,760
Well, this is actually unifiable with both
of the heads of the addition clauses.

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,440
So, we get two successors.

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
The first one is by resolution with the fact.

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,040
So, this will make the query actually smaller.

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,800
Because with this unification,

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
with this substitution, we can
unify this literal and this fact.

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
And the successor will be this
because this literal disappears.

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Because there is no right-hand
side to this clause.

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,120
And we are left with whatever
remains in the query.

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,640
But of course, we have to apply
the substitution unifier to it.

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
So, that's why we get this as our new sub-call.

81 # slide
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,360
So, let's proceed from there.

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,480
Of course, this is now the next place where
we need to look for resolution opportunities.

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,360
And indeed, this is both unifiable
with this head and with this head.

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,240
So, we again get two successor nodes.

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,040
The left one is actually
leading to an empty node because

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,360
if we unify this with mult(0,_,0), which
can be done with this substitution.

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
Then we replace this by
the empty right-hand side.

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,120
So, we get an empty query.

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,400
And as before, we can see what
this solution actually is.

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,000
N is s(X), X is not changed here.

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
But X is changed to 0 here.

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,680
So, N will be s(0), and M
becomes Y, Y becomes s(0).

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,080
So, the answer is N = s(0), M = s(0).

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Okay, first solution.

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,040
How to look for further solutions?

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Well, we now have actually two places
where we could continue the search.

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,360
But the verbal description said that
from these, you always take the leftmost.

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:35,040
So, we don't explore this path further
where we would arrive if we resolve this

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,840
with the second additional clause;
instead, we first look at this node.

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
Okay, this would have arisen by

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,120
unifying this literal with the second
program clause for multiplication.

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,640
After, of course, replacing the X,
Y, Z, et cetera by renamed variants.

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
So, since we already used X1 here,
let's say X2, Y2, Z2, et cetera.

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,880
And then unify this with what
we have in the literal here,

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,240
then we'll find that this is the unifier to use.

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:14,960
Yes, X becomes s(X2), this Z2
becomes 0, and this Y2 becomes s(0).

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,080
Okay, so that's why we have this unifier here.

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,840
And what will be the new query?

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,800
Well, we replace this by the right-hand
side of the clause that we use, but

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,040
also applying a substitution
to this right-hand side.

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,640
So, in particular, this Y2 which we
would have here now after the renaming

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
becomes s(0), and the Z2 becomes 0.

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,200
So, this is the next program
clause, the next query.

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,040
Okay, how to make progress?

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,360
Well, let's look at the leftmost literal.

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,920
And let's try to unify it with any
of the program clauses for addition.

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,440
Okay, let's see add(0, X, X)
is not unifiable with this.

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,800
Because these two are not the same.

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,480
Okay?

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
So, there could be only one successor.

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,920
add(s(X), Y, s(Z)) is also not
unifiable with this literal.

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,120
Because of the 0 here
and the s(something) here.

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,200
So, actually, there is no
successor for this query.

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,520
Yes, because you have to
use the leftmost literal.

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,400
But we can't resolve it with either of
the addition clauses from the program.

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,680
So, actually, this is a finished
node, which isn't a successor node.

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,120
And you need some symbol for this.

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,000
So, let's use this lightning bolt here to
say, well, we can't make any progress here.

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,680
It's a finished node, but it's not a successful
node because it's not the empty node.

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Hence, we also don't write any solution
for it, because there is no solution here.

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,480
That's a failed node, which is somewhat successful
in the sense of cutting short the search, right?

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,160
Because if we had the opposite order
of multiplication and addition here,

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,560
it would have made further steps
trying to resolve this multiplication

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,800
and never realizing that there is no solution.

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,480
But by switching the order here, having the
addition first, we can actually cut off the whole

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,960
any further search in this part of the tree.

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,440
That doesn't yet mean that we are finished because
there is another node which is unfinished, right?

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,000
So, here we already mentioned that
there would be another successor node.

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,560
Because we could also unify this
with the second clause for addition.

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,440
So, let's do this.

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,000
Because this is now the
leftmost not yet finished node.

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,240
Okay.

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,520
So, this would have arisen by
the following substitution.

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,320
Yes, repeating this X3, Y3, Z3, et cetera.

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,960
And then unifying, for example, the Z3
has to be 0 because of this position.

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:50,080
And the U here becomes s(X3) from here
and the Y and Y3 are simply renamed,

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
one is renamed to the other.

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay, what's then the right-hand
side at the new query here?

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,680
Well, we have to replace this by the
right-hand side while applying the unifier.

00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,080
So, the Z in particular will become 0.

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
But you also have to keep the context.

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,320
So, we have to keep this multiplication literal.

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,880
And to it, we also apply the unifier.

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
This leads to this new query.

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
At least it hasn't gotten longer.

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,240
Yeah, it's still two literals long, so we
have to make further searches, further steps.

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
Okay, what do we do?

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,000
We look at the leftmost
literal, which is this one.

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,400
We try to unify it with the clauses for addition.

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
We can see that it doesn't
unify with the second clause.

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
Because s(something) versus 0.

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,880
So, the only thing that could happen here
is that we unify this with the first

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,080
clause, which is a fact.

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,840
Is this unifiable?

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
Yes, if you set everything to 0.

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,320
Yes, with this unifier, they are

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
With this substitution, these two are unifiable.

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,400
And here we also see a case
where I have renamed the X to X4.

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,680
So, that I don't confuse it with X3, et cetera.

00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,160
Okay, so this is possible.

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Then we get a new query.

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,960
This disappears because the
right-hand side is empty.

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,880
But we are left with the rest of the query
to which we also have to apply the unifier.

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
So, this is the next proof goal.

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,280
Yes, this is the X.

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,720
This Y3 becomes 0, and
this X3 also becomes 0.

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
Okay, so let's see, can we make progress?

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,720
Well, is this unifiable with any of
the program clauses for multiplication?

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,240
It's not unifiable with the first
one because of 0 versus s(0).

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
So, there can only be one successor.

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,240
But this successor really exists because
this is indeed unifiable with the

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,040
head of the second multiplication clause.

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,440
Yes, replacing these by X5, Y5, et cetera.

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,480
And then performing unification
leads to this substitution.

00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,160
Okay, so then we have to replace
this by the right-hand side.

00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,840
So, it becomes longer again.

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,360
So, we have to replace it by these two literals
with this substitution applied, which means this.

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,560
Okay, not yet finished, we have
to continue on the next slide.

82 # slide
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,280
So, that's what we have so far.

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,360
So, let's look at this right
part of the tree and this was

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,800
the query we ended up with on the previous slide.

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:32,400
So, let's focus on the leftmost literal and try
to unify it with the program clauses for addition.

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,880
We don't have to consider the first
one because these are not the same.

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay.

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,040
So, we only have to unify with the
second program clause for addition.

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,560
And it is unifiable.

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
As you can see from here, we can get a 0.

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
We can also set this to 0.

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,600
And U5 will be s(X6).

00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
Yes, because you already used X5 here.

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,560
So, we are now replacing these
with X6, Y6, Z6, et cetera.

00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:09,680
And then we can unify. Well, the result
is this becomes replaced by the right-hand

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,440
side of this query, applying this
clause, applying the unifier.

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,680
But we also keep the remainder of the query
and also apply the unifier to this part.

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
Which leads to the following query.

00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:38,480
Okay, X6 because of this 0, 0 because all the
Y and Z from the clause became replaced by 0.

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,240
And in the remainder in the context here
we have to replace the U5 with s(X6)?

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,560
Okay, new query.

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,680
How to make progress?

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,920
Well, let's look at the leftmost literal.

00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,960
Try to unify it with the addition clauses.

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
It won't unify with the second clause
because of the s(something) versus 0.

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
But it does, of course, unify with the fact here.

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,160
Namely, if you replace everything
with 0 then (0,0,0) matches (0,0,0).

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
Okay, so this can be done.

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,840
What is the next query?

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,160
Well, this becomes replaced by empty.

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,720
Because there's no right-hand
side for this clause.

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,520
So, actually, the query
now becomes smaller again.

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:27,440
We are left with this remainder of the query,
where we have to apply the substitution.

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
So, we get this as the new query.

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,220
Okay.

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Now, is this a fruitful process?

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,720
Not very much.

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
Because if you do this, again, a few steps,

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,560
you will realize that this
is still an infinite branch.

00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,520
Why is this?

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,280
Well, we can see it actually, if you
look at this place and this place.

00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,120
They look very similar.

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,760
So, well, just the variable
name is different here.

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,880
But all the steps we made
to get from here to here

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,240
could be made again here and
have to be made again here.

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
So, after three more resolution steps, we
will again be in a very similar place.

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,360
So, this is, of course, not such a big
tree as the previous infinite tree.

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
Where all the queries got longer and longer.

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,280
But nevertheless, this is
an infinite search path.

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,840
So, again, the program that we have now
is a bit nicer than the previous one,

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
but it still has an infinite search.

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,760
So, we might have to make some further changes.

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,600
So, let's come back to this in the next video.
