00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,720
After talking about unification
and resolution in the last week,

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
this week we will look at the derivation trees

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,800
that will conclude the consideration of
the operational semantics with Prolog.

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,800
And what we will see is basically a
visualization of the search process of Prolog.

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,840
That is how individual resolution
steps are combined into a

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,720
somewhat exhaustive search
for solutions to a query.

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,040
And since it's so specific to Prolog, now this
will look a bit different from resolution.

00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,640
The whole resolution process is
visualized in the Logik lecture.

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,200
So, unification and individual
resolution steps are really

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,720
very similar to the general
setting from that other lecture,

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,920
but the derivation trees that you'll see here
are not something that appeared there, I think.

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,880
Because they are really tailored towards Prolog,

00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,840
but individual steps are just
resolution steps as seen before.

76 # slide
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
As a reminder for why we even want to have

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,320
operational semantics and see what is going on
during execution, we had this example earlier

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:32,080
on, and we would know how to use the declarative
semantics to know what this program means, right?

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,840
By just using these rules in the
immediate consequence operator, and

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
then seeing which facts are produced, which
literals are produced one after the other.

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
But we also saw that if you
actually use this program in

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
a Prolog interpreter, some
strange things can happen.

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,960
In particular, we were very happy that we could
use this program of addition and multiplication in

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,040
a forward mode, right?

00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
We can really say, what is two times three?

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
And then the answer was the correct number six.

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,480
And we also saw that you can, for example,
use it to essentially do division.

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,760
We can ask what is N such
that two times N is four.

00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,360
So, basically, we can divide four by
two and get the correct result two.

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,600
But then we also saw that unlike some other
predicates, like the addition predicate, which also

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,440
worked in a more general backward
fashion where the result was given,

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,040
and the two arguments were asked,
for multiplication, this didn't work.

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
So, if we tried to use this multiplication
predicate for factorizations or

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,440
asking for both factors, such that their
product is four, then something strange happens.

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,560
We got the results one times four, two times two.

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
But we didn't get an answer
where N is four and M is one.

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,320
So, essentially, we had to abort this. Otherwise,
we would have had an infinite search here.

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Which is not really apparent from the
program why this would be a problem, right?

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,320
Because if you really ask whether
multiplication of four times one

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,440
and four holds, then Prolog will say yes, but
if you ask for N and M, then this didn't work.

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
And the declarative semantics
couldn't explain this.

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
And I promised that the operational
semantics would explain this.

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Moreover, we will not only
explain what's going on here.

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,360
We will also discuss, on this specific
case study of this small program, how

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
using the operational semantics and the insight one
gets from knowing what derivation trees look like,

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,560
how one could actually repair this program in the
sense of making it useful for further call modes.

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,680
So, such that we can also ask questions like this

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,360
for a slightly changed program at which
we arrived by studying derivation trees.

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,440
So, I will use this program or actually on the
next slide I will first use a smaller program

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,600
with just the addition to give you a first
glimpse of how derivation trees look like.

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Then we'll talk about the general
process of producing them.

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,480
And then we will illustrate this process
by looking at this program as a whole,

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,880
where we will also see why some queries
are problematic for the program as written,

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,120
even though logically the rules that
we have here are perfectly okay.

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,080
And then we'll use this example by
making small changes to the program,

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,920
exploring how we could change it in
such a way that it becomes more useful.

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
And by doing this, you will
again and again look at

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,160
derivation trees because that's
how we find out what is going on.

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,840
And in that sense, this example will also both
serve for introducing derivation trees and seeing

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,320
several different examples of derivation
trees for this and slightly related programs.

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,440
And at the same time, we will
learn a bit about how to manipulate

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,720
a Prolog program to make it more useful,
for example, for backwards execution.

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,400
So, this program will serve both these purposes.

77 # slide
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,320
So, let us look at this small program, just
the addition rules from the previous slide.

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,760
And let's look at this query which
is similar to the multi-query

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,840
from the previous slide that didn't work

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,080
in the sense that you give a result of addition
and ask for the two contributing arguments, okay?

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,080
And well, we know that there are several solutions
to this by knowing what addition actually means.

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,200
We know that there must be several
solutions here because, for example,

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
0 + 2 is 2, but also 1 + 1 is 2.

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,640
So, there must be some search involved and
indeed, it’s an exhaustive search process.

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,240
But of course, the question is, how
does the search exactly proceed?

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
For example, also in which order
are solutions actually found?

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,200
And how could it be in another query
that this search is maybe infinite?

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
This would not happen on this
slide, but in later examples.

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Okay, so what kind of search is going on here?

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,200
Well, by resolution steps, we have a query,

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,280
you want to know an answer to
this, and we have the program.

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:04,080
And as mentioned before,
we proceed by resolution.

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,920
So, we try to resolve the query
that we have with the facts

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
and rules, so all the
program clauses that we have.

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
And there is some order involved.

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,200
So, for example, it was also already
mentioned that we proceed top to bottom.

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,600
So, essentially, we'll look with this
query, which contains only one literal.

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
So, there is no choice to make.

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,760
So, we want to resolve this literal
with first the fact from the program.

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,640
What does this mean?

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,880
That means that we need to find out whether we

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
can perform one resolution step
with this fact and this query.

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,360
So, remember from last week, that means
that first we have to look for a unifier

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,200
between the program clause.

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,840
So, this fact, the head of the program
clause, in this case just this fact

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,440
and the query that we have selected,
which in this case it's just this.

00:06:51,440 --> 00:07:00,240
Okay, so is it the case that add(0, X, X)
and add(N, M, s(s(0))) is at all unifiable?

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Well, we could apply an algorithm to find out.

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,440
But actually, in this case, as in many cases in
a simple example that we have in the lecture,

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,160
this is actually quite apparent
that yes, these are unifiable.

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,840
We only need to replace N by 0,
and M and X both by s(s(0)), right?

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
So, this is forced.

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,040
So, N must be 0 otherwise the first position
wouldn't match. And the second position:

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,840
M and X are both variables, so there
is a lot of freedom in what to do,

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,640
but actually the last position
we see that X must be s(s(0)).

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,920
So, that really forces the value for X.

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,240
And then since X is then s(s(0)).

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
So, which will also affect the
second position here in this,

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,160
by instantiating this head, this fact,
well then M must also be substituted

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,760
by s(s(0)). Otherwise, you wouldn't
have a match in the second position.

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
So, this means that the

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,960
unifier, the most general unifier actually the
only unifier we can use here must be this one.

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
N is replaced by 0, M and X
are both replaced by s(s(0)).

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,560
Okay, that means that we can resolve the
query with this head, with this fact.

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Okay, then what is the result of resolution?

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,400
Well, remember in the general

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,600
setting we might have a context P
and Q of this literal and the query.

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Of course, in this case, P and Q
are both empty so nothing is left

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
from them as they don't contribute
anything to the next step.

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,840
And then the other part of the application
of a solution was to replace the L.

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,160
The query that you actually used for a solution

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,000
by the right-hand side of the program
clause by which we have resolved.

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,120
Okay, now this program clause in
this specific case is a fact.

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,840
So, there is no body, the right side is empty.

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,440
So, that was the case where we replaced the
L by some L1 to Ln, where n is actually 0.

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
So, we replaced this literal by nothing.

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
So, what remains is actually
an empty query, right?

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
This was the only query.

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
The only literal still appearing in the query.

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,738
Well, if this disappears because
we replace it with the empty right

00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:10,400
hand side of this first program
clause, then nothing is left.

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
And this nothing is actually where there
must be some visualization for this.

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,960
And what we use here is what was often used in

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
visualizations of Prolog derivation
trees, is such an empty box.

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,280
So, this box means, well, no query literals left.

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,520
Okay, which is exactly the case
after this resolution step, okay?

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,640
And if we reached this, then this means nothing
is left to prove for this specific search path.

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
So, that means we have found a solution.

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
So, the Prolog interpreter now
says true, or gives a result.

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually, in this case, you
don't want to just get true.

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
We want to get actual values for N and M, right?

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,640
If you have variables appearing in the
query, then when we have a successful

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,320
proof of the predicate of the query, we
want to see the results for N and M.

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,600
Now, where could they come from?

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
Well, of course they have to
come from the unification, right?

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,240
This was where we found out
what N and M must be in order

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
to apply to this first rule, this first clause.

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,280
And well, if in the end you want to
know what N and M are in our solution,

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,600
then of course they are what
is written here, 0 and s(s(0)).

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
This would be more complicated if you have several
steps that will appear here in the right-hand side

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,000
of the tree, where there is not just one
unification and you have to compose them.

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,400
But in this very simple case here, you can
simply read off the values of N and M from this

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
one unification, this substitution.

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
Okay? So, actually, that's
what Prolog would now output.

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,440
The value for N and the value for M
that led us to this successful proof.

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,280
Okay, first result.

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,520
Now the user might enter a semicolon to
ask, well, are there any further results?

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
And of course, there might be
because we still have another

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
rule in the program that
you could have used, right?

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,920
Instead of, at this point, deciding
to unify with the fact here,

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,560
you could also have tried to unify with the
head of the second rule, the second clause.

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
And Prolog will actually do both.

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,640
Yes, Prolog doesn't have like Haskell,
the strategy of applying only one

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,840
equation per function definition.

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,080
It always tries all of them.

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,640
And trying means checking whether this literal
could also have been unified with the head of

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
the second clause.

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,760
Okay, so let's look at this.

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,880
Okay, now this is a bit more complicated
of course, because we have variables in

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,920
different places where we don't simply match all
these variables against a ground term, right?

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
Because you have, for example, N and s(X).

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,240
Neither of them is a ground term, okay?

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,400
So, we need to unify where there are
some things that can be easily seen.

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,720
For example, by looking at the third
position, we see that Z must be s(0).

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
That's the only way how this position
and this position could be unified.

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,880
Well here, we see N should be s(X) and
we could either have M is Y or Y is M.

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,760
Okay, that could be the unifier.

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,680
One of these could be the unifier
that we put on another branch here

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,040
because we have a choice
here to use the second rule.

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,960
Okay, actually I will from now on,
usually rename the variables in the query.

00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,080
I mentioned this before already that, in
particular, if you apply a rule several times

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,440
in the search process, after a few resolution
steps, you might get confused between,

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,800
for example, the X appearing in this rule, in
the first rule and then also in the second rule.

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,640
So, what I will be doing from now
on is to replace the variables here.

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,560
And I will do this by just adding a subscript.

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
It would be a subscript, if I
would write it mathematically.

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,040
But actually, I will just add a
number after the variable name.

00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,080
So, instead of actually unifying this
literal with the rule as written here,

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,160
I will in my head, and you will see now, in
the unification variable names accordingly,

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,320
I will replace this X by X1, Y by Y1, Z by Z1, et
cetera, consistently throughout the whole rule.

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
And then I will apply unification.

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,600
As a consequence of this, actually this is
what the unification will look like, right?

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,520
So, this N should be replaced by s(X1),
because I have silently replaced X by X1.

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:33,840
M unifies with Y1 and Z1 from here, should be s(0)
because then we can match these two positions.

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,760
Okay, so this is the unifier to
use for resolution of this literal

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,080
and this second clause. What's the
outcome of this resolution step?

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,200
Well, again, there is no constant context
P or Q in the literal, in the query so

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,400
actually, we only have to deal with this literal.

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,280
Well, dealing with it means
replacing it by the right-hand side

00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
of the rule from the program that you have used.

00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
And now that this is really
non-empty, we won't get

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,800
the empty query immediately because now we place
this after unification with the right-hand side.

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,160
And of course, we take the right-hand
side of the renamed variable names.

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,240
So, X1, Y1, Z1, but we apply the unifier to them.

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,480
Okay?

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:24,720
So, we don't get add(X1,Y1,Z1), but actually
add(X1,Y1,...), because they are not

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,000
mapped by the substitution,
but Z1 is actually s(0).

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Okay, so the next query is this one.

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,120
add(X1,Y1,s(0)) because the Z1 was
replaced according to this substitution.

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
Okay, so that is now our new subquery.

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
So, haven't found our solution
here, we have a new problem.

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
Okay, now what do we do?

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,840
Well, if this is our new query, we can make progress
by resolving it with clauses from the program.

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,600
And again, we have to look at both of them
because you always have to look at all of them.

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,960
So, we first check.

00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,840
Yes, top to bottom.

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:05,760
We first check as the first child of this tree
node, whether this is unifiable with this fact.

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,440
And now it already pays off
that we have replaced X by X1,

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,520
because otherwise we would now have X here and
that could be confused with this X in some way.

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,800
Okay, so what do we do?

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,840
We look at this query and we look
at this head and we do unification.

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,760
Actually, we always also
replace the X by X2 here.

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,680
So, we look at the fact add(0, X2, X2) and
try to unify this with what we have here.

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,840
And is this unifiable?

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:40,800
Yes.

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,880
So, this X1 certainly becomes 0
because of the first position,

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,040
then we see that this X2 must be s(0)
because of the third argument position.

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,120
And then since this is the same X1
or X2, also, Y1 must become s(0).

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay, so the unifier that you
will get here is this one,

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,320
X1/0 because of this, and both Y1 and
the implicit X2 here must be s(0).

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,520
Okay, then we have that unified.

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,560
Then resolution means replacing this
literal by the right-hand side of this

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,680
clause that we have used, that is the empty
right-hand side because this was a fact.

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
So, actually, we will again,
produce an empty query here.

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Which means that this is another success node
and another solution that Prolog has found

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
for this query and this program.

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,680
Now, what are the answers for N and M?

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,360
So, now we have several indirections, right?

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
We have more than one substitution.

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,640
So, we actually have to compose them.

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,040
And that means that you look
at the variables that occurred

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
in the query for which you
want to have an answer.

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,280
And then we go through the substitutions
and see what happens to these variables.

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,640
So, N becomes s(X1), but
the answer can't be s(X1)

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,640
because actually X1 is also
replaced by something, by 0.

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,280
So, N becomes s(X1), and s(X1) then
becomes s(0) because of this here.

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
So, the answer for N will be s(0).

00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,080
What about M?

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,760
M becomes Y1, Y1 becomes s(0).

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,880
So, the answer will be N and M are both s(0).

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
Which makes sense, because one plus one is two.

00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay?

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,880
Second answer that Prolog would give us.

00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,480
If you want to see more answers
than we have to see, well,

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,800
was there a place where we could
have made a different choice.

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,160
And the answer is yes, because for this
node, we so far only considered resolution

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,920
with the first clause, but we should also
consider a resolution with the second clause.

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,160
Okay, so let's look at this.

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
Is this unifiable with the
head of this last clause?

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Well, let’s again rename these to X3, Y3,
Z3, and then see whether we can unify.

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,400
Well, s(Z3) should be s(0) so certainly,
the Z3 from here should be replaced by 0.

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,240
What else?

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,120
We have X1 here, a variable here
and s of another variable X3 here.

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
So, we should replace X1 by s(X3).

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,920
And for the Y3 here, and the Y1 here, we could
have a choice, actually, whether we want to

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,120
replace Y1 by Y3 or Y3 by Y1; in both cases
you would have found a most general unifier.

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,680
Okay, we will actually use this one.

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:31,840
So, X1 is replaced by s(X3), Y1
replaced by Y3, and Z3 replaced by 0.

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,040
Then this has been unified, okay?

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,120
So, resolution is possible.

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,520
We can replace this literal by the
right-hand side of the clause we have used.

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,440
So, we will replace this by add(X3,Y3,Z3),
but actually, of course, we will

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,720
apply this unifier to this term.

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,640
And since this changes Z3, the next
query is actually add(X3, Y3, 0).

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,520
There it is, not yet empty so
we have to make further steps.

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,120
So, let's see whether this is unifiable with the
first clause, with the head of the first clause.

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,760
Well, (0, X4, X4) and (X3, Y3, 0).

00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,880
Well, it's not difficult to see that
this is unifiable if you replace all

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,720
variables or the X3, Y3, and the
X4 from the clause, all by 0.

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
And we are forced to do this because
of this 0 here and this 0 here.

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,360
Okay?

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,960
So, the unifier to use is this one;
then we can apply the first clause.

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,240
That means replacing this
literal by its right-hand side,

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
by the clause on the right
hand side which is empty.

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
So, this gives the empty query.

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,640
What are the answers?

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
Well, let's see.

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,320
N becomes s(X1), X1 becomes s(X3).

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,000
So, we have s(s(X3)) and X3 becomes 0.

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
So, N altogether becomes s(s(0)).

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,960
What about M?

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,680
M becomes Y1, Y1 becomes Y3, and Y3 becomes 0.

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,840
So, M altogether, if you trace
it through here, becomes 0.

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,600
So, we have the answer, N is s(s(0)) and M is 0.

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,120
Which is the third useful answer for asking
whether addition of N + M should be 2.

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,040
Okay, now then I could again
ask, give me further solutions.

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,440
Then Prolog would have to check whether the last
literal that we had here could also have been

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,280
unified with the second program clause, with the
head of this clause, and well, the answer is no.

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,040
We see this in the last position, so the
head here has something like s of something.

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,000
And here, the last argument is 0.

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
So, this is not unifiable.

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Okay, so there is no second branch here
that would lead to further solutions.

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,880
So, at this point, Prolog can really
say, well, these are the three solutions

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,800
and there are no further ones because there
is no further choice that can be made.

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,920
And that's why Prolog would give these three
results in this order from left to right.

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,520
And then say false; there are
no further solutions, I am done.

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:20,960
Okay?

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:29,840
So, this explains exactly what happens when
Prolog has this query to solve with this program.

78 # slide
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,360
So, let's keep track of what we have
just done on this example and then later

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,240
apply the same procedure to
the more complicated example.

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,560
Okay, so this was the process
that we basically followed.

00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,720
We started by generating a root
node for our derivation tree,

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,600
and that root node contained exactly the
query from which you want to have solutions.

00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,640
Okay?

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
And at the beginning, this was a new
node which had not been worked on, and

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,400
throughout the process of generating
this tree, we always had to remember

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,520
where we have already worked, where
we are done, and where we are not.

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,080
And this proceeded basically in
a left-most depth-first fashion.

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,280
Okay, as long as there are still nodes to be
worked on, which in the beginning, it’s just the

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,840
node, the root node query, we will have to select
one such node, and there could be several ones.

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
And we always select the leftmost one.

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,440
Okay?

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,560
Of course, in the beginning, there
is just the one we have at the root.

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,480
Okay, then having a node that has to be worked
on, we have to find out which are its successors.

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,440
And a strategy for this was to determine
all facts or rules, all program clauses

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,520
whose head is unifiable with some literal, but
actually the leftmost literal in that node.

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,440
And as you just saw, there was
always exactly one literal in each

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,120
query in all the nodes, but in general
there could be several literals in a query.

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
And we always use the leftmost one.

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay?

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,680
So, for a node that we want to work on further
because it was the leftmost still unfinished node,

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:18,880
we look at the leftmost literal and see to which
heads from the program rules it can be unified.

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,360
And in the previous example, it
was almost always two successors,

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
two such clauses that could be used.

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,920
Well, except in the rightmost node at the very
end, there was exactly one clause that could be

00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,840
used for unification because the second one
was ruled out because there was a mismatch.

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,600
Okay, so when we know what the
unifiers should be, we can,

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,960
for each of them, create a successor
node by doing a resolution.

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,480
Yes, after we have found out the unification
between the leftmost literal in the current node

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,480
and the problem clause, we can apply
resolution for that literal, for the

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,080
query with that literal as a
selected one and the problem clause.

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,600
Okay?

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,920
What this gives us are new nodes
that still have to be worked on.

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
So, they are arranged from
left to right according

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,280
to the order of appearance of
the clauses in the program.

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,920
So, remember we had two clauses in the previous
example and in nodes where we had two successors,

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,360
we always put the successor that
corresponded to applying a fact,

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
the first program clause to the left.

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,960
And the other successor node
that corresponded to the

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,000
second program clause for addition,
we always put it to the right.

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:38,880
Okay?

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,560
So, these successors are arranged in
this fashion, from left to right.

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,960
First rule from the program
is the first successor, okay?

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,720
On the arrows, the connections from
the nodes to the successor nodes, we

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,600
annotate the unifier because
we'll need it later on, right?

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
That was also something we did in all
examples on the previous slide in each step.

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,880
We put the unifier that we had found out, U,
for resolution. We wrote it on the connection.

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,960
Okay, then there are two possible
cases how a node could be finished.

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,160
Well, actually in the previous

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,280
example, there was only one such case; the other
one will appear in another example later on.

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,480
So, what we are seeing so far is only that
a node can be finished because it's empty.

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,560
And we saw this several times in the previous

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,040
slide that we arrived after a
resolution step at the empty query.

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,920
Then that's a finished node
and it's a solution node.

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,600
There’s also another case that can happen, and
you'll see that later on. It can also be the case

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,200
that we have a query which is not yet empty, but
actually, there's no program clause at all which

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,760
can be unified, whose head can be unified
with the leftmost literal from the query.

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,560
Then we also have finished that node, but it's
not a success node, it's a failure node because

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,320
there's some stuff still left to prove, but we
can't use any program clause to make progress.

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,560
So, we will actually have to use another
notation for the second kind of finished nodes.

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,920
And this will appear later on.

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,040
For the empty nodes, we use this box annotation,

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,240
because then we know this
is a finished proof part.

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
Okay, and at these successful nodes,

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,040
yes, the ones that are finished because
they are empty, we can write a solution.

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,440
Yes, the answer for what the variables from
the original query should be for this solution.

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,040
And this was done by looking
at the unifiers on the path

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,920
from the root node up to this successful node,

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,920
we had several unifiers in some cases, so we had to
compose them in the sense of function composition.

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,680
And then we apply this to all the variables
that occurred in the original query, right?

00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,240
So, in the tree, we had many

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,960
variables, N, M, X, Y, X1, Y1, etc., but
we didn't give an answer for all of them.

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,840
So, actually at a success node, we simply
wrote down the values that we get by

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,400
composing these unifiers and applying them to the
variables that occurred in the original query.

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
So, N and M.

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,600
That’s why we also only put N and M
values at all these success nodes.

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
Because that's what Prolog would also answer.

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,120
Okay, and if you look at the previous slide,

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,600
then you will see that we have
really followed these steps.

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,680
Okay.

00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:39,680
And we will now apply them to a more complicated
program in the next video, of course.
