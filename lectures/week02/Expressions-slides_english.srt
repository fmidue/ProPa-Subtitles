18 # slide
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,640
Back to the slides.

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:14,060
I mentioned that one thing I want to do
today is to discuss expressions vs. commands.

00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:20,060
Expressions are things that I
discussed in the whiteboard video.

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,910
The mathematical formulas, for
example, are arithmetic expressions.

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,990
And commands, on the other hand, are things
like "print" or an assignment in an imperative

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,119
language.

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,350
Often, expressions are also called "terms",
and commands are often called "statements".

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:44,660
And I think I will use, in both cases, either
terminology, without much thinking, actually.

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,990
So, let's think about
expression-based programming.

00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,420
Let me actually first say that for today's
lecture, mainly we are not even doing functional

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,260
programming, but the point is more
about expression-based programming.

00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,280
We will use functions in our expressions.

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,610
And also in the first CodeWorld tasks
that you will get, you will use functions.

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,909
But you will probably not
define your own functions.

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,079
So, it is mainly about building
expressions from functions.

00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,590
So, what is an expression?

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,710
Well, it is as in the statement I just made:

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,810
Functional programming is mainly about expressions,
whereas imperative programming is about the

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,840
other thing, about commands.

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,539
And that is what we saw when I discussed
the differences in the whiteboard video.

00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,009
What's an expression?

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,469
Well, you know many expressions
in all kinds of languages.

00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,770
For example, arithmetic expressions,
as occurred in the video.

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:39,340
So, "2 + 3 × (x+1)^2" or the
examples that I showed in the video.

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,840
These are expressions.

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,109
Things that are built from symbols, from
variables, constants, and operations.

00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,649
This is not only something for arithmetics.

00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:55,669
For example, in logic, you know propositional
logic formulas that could look like this.

00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:57,749
And this is also an expression.

00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:02,969
Or, in an Excel spreadsheet, you might use
expressions to describe what should be the

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,570
value of a certain cell.

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,759
Other examples would be expressions in SQL.

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,090
When you do database queries, the language
in which you write them, SQL, is also very

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,290
much an expression-based language.

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,510
So, these things are built up from parts.

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,069
They have a certain syntax.

00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:27,239
And you get structured expressions, similarly
to what I showed last week in the CodeWorld

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,769
editor, where I also explored the
tree underlying a picture expression.

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,870
And indeed, we can write down the syntax trees.

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,770
And maybe I will do this on an
example in another short video later.

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:49,209
Generally, mathematically speaking, a term,
an expression, is simply something that is

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,209
built from a signature.

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,469
So, we have constants, functions/operators,
possibly variables, as discussed earlier in

00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:58,530
my other expression examples.

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,569
So, what's the point?

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,909
What are the properties of expressions,
or specifically, of pure expressions?

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,500
Later, we will discuss the difference:
whether they are compositional.

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,069
As I just said, expressions are
built completely from subexpressions.

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,690
So if you take an expression, draw it down as
a tree, and then point at any node in that

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,989
tree, then what you get rooted at that point
is just another expression, a subexpression.

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,129
That is not true for commands, as we will
see.

00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,969
Expressions usually have a
type, or can be given a type.

00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:40,090
In the example we just saw (the arithmetic
expression), of course all the subexpressions

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,659
and also the whole expression
had a numerical type.

00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,560
Depending on what x might be, it could be
natural numbers or real numbers, whatever.

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,110
But, the point is, we can assign types to
expressions and to their subexpressions.

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,969
They usually have a value.

00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,409
Expressions can be evaluated.

00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:01,249
So, we take "2 + 3 × (x+1)^2".

00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:07,400
And if you know what x is, if we have (in
scope) a variable x, with which we have a

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,540
value assigned, then we know what
the value of the whole expression is.

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,200
And this happens without any hidden influences:
If we know the variables, then we know what

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,209
the result of an expression is.

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,160
And it doesn't change if we evaluate
the expression several times.

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,020
If the variables are the same, have the same
values, then the result of evaluation will

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,090
always be the same.

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,180
Also, the result of evaluation does not depend
on the order in which we evaluate subexpressions.

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,849
Therefore, pure expressions: if we have "a + b"
and "a" and "b" are more complex subexpressions,

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,840
then it doesn't matter in which order
we evaluate the left and the right side.

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,860
The sum will always be the same.

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,349
Again, something that is not in general true
for impure expressions in a language like

00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,650
C, for example.

00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,280
And this compositionality
is not just syntactical.

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,819
It really extends to typing
and semantics/evaluation.

00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:12,729
So, let's take our very simple
example from two slides ago.

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,840
What are the ingredients here?

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,630
Well, we have the constants 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,060
They have a type: the whole numbers ℤ.

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,199
We have some operators.

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,789
They could also be given types.

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,930
Usually, in mathematics, you don't really write
down the types of these very simple operators.

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,080
But of course, you could do that.

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,330
And you have binary operations and a unary
operation (the square-operator), and then

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,889
if you want to know what the value of "two
plus three times something" is, then we go

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,289
through these subexpressions and simply evaluate
all the subexpressions, and then accumulate

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,500
the results.

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,220
This, of course, is all very trivial.

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,540
That's exactly what you do when you
calculate with simple arithmetic expressions.

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,490
The point here is that this extends to all
the other examples of expressions we have

00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,490
seen.

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,819
And, in particular, it applies
to every Haskell program.

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:07,190
So for Haskell programs, their
semantics is only given by evaluation.

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,740
And that's definitely not
true in imperative languages.

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:19,840
The examples we saw last week, with the
pictures, were just one instantiation of this.

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Okay.

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,009
What does this buy us?

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:32,550
Also, again, somehow relating to the
whiteboard video that I did previously.

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,289
Well, we can use all kinds of
notations from mathematics.

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:44,510
So, a simple thing, like if you have "2 + 3
× (something)^2", we might as well write this

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,730
as "2 + 3 × (y^2)" and give
a name to that subexpression.

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:56,169
So, a trivial thing in this case, but for more
complex programs, such naming of arbitrary

00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,370
subexpressions is a valuable thing.

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,759
You will see this when you build more
complex Haskell programs, for example.

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,349
Again, something that's not immediate and not
always possible in a command-based language,

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:10,510
as you will see.

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:17,340
And, as I have actually already demonstrated with
the "read() + read()" example on the whiteboard,

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,560
we can apply simplifications.

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:28,530
So, for example, maybe y^2 is an expensive
operation, and we could instead multiply y

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,530
with y.

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,740
Well, of course, mathematically, that is okay.

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,069
That is exactly the same as here.

00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,069
Why?

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:40,520
Because y is a variable that's always,
in scope, having the same value.

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,790
It is like the "f(x) + f(x) is 2 ×
f(x)" example from my previous video.

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:57,460
So, of course, again, it might seem
trivial, applied to arithmetic expressions.

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,810
But the point is that these concepts apply
much more generally, if we buy into the notion

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,120
that we should program only
with functions and expressions.

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,990
If we stay away from impure expressions, if
we stay away from commands, then we can apply

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,490
everything we know from algebra.

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,340
Everything we know from mathematics, in terms
of manipulating formulas, rearranging formulas,

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
etc.

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,970
All these things can be applied to programs,
if programs are just built from expressions.

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:41,760
This last point is the important thing here:
This applies if you have only pure expressions.

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,600
In what sense is this different
from imperative programming?

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,810
So, why is what I just said only true in certain
kinds of programs, that we are aiming for

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,380
at the moment (expression-based programs)?

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,410
Well, let's have a look.

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,190
This is some prototypical
imperative programming code.

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,210
So, this could be C or Java.

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,960
It could also be Python with a little bit
of manipulation or a few changes in syntax.

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,400
Certainly, we also have expressions here,
right?

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,910
So, I mean: This constant is an expression.

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,000
This addition here looks like an expression.

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,660
We have expressions in the
condition of this while-loop.

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,830
Here, we have, again, an arithmetic
expression which calculates something.

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,690
So, what's different now?

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,320
Well, the point is that, of course, there are
expressions here as well, but they are not

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,190
the dominating syntactical construct.

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,870
There are many things in this piece of
program code that are not expressions.

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,120
For example, "while" is a keyword.

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,230
The assignment here is a command.

00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:01,730
On the right side, we have an expression, but
as a whole, this line here is not an expression.

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:10,630
So, it's not true that everything is, syntactically,
composed of the same kind of construct like

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:16,190
in a purely expression-based language
(and like really in mathematics).

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:23,270
Why is this relevant?

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:29,340
What properties do commands not
have that we know from expressions?

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,940
Well, they are not compositional.

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:38,820
So, it's not the case that if you have a command,
then all its smaller-size-contained parts

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,620
are themselves commands.

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,280
That's already not true in this thing:

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,050
This loop is certainly a command, as a
whole, and there are commands inside.

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,230
But, for example, this here is not a command.

00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,380
We have expressions, keywords, etc.,
as highlighted on the previous slide.

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,070
Moreover, commands do not
always have a meaningful type.

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:12,830
For example, it's not clear what
the type of this command is.

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,820
It doesn't really compute a value.

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,370
Indeed, it doesn't have value.

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,170
So, some expressions here have a value.

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,370
This, for example, depending on what "b"
is, will evaluate to "true" or "false".

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,330
But the loop, as a whole, doesn't have a value.

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,570
There is no really meaningful way
to say what the value should be.

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,380
Or it would be a trivial value.

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,420
The same for some subparts: Let's only
take the block from here to here.

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,430
This is a sequence of statements, but
it is not something that has a value.

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,430
Why?

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,980
Because for a command, the important
thing is what effect it has.

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,300
So, if you look at this assignment here, what's
interesting to the programmer about this is

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,660
that j will afterwards have a
different value than before.

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,390
But the statement itself doesn't
have an interesting value.

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:15,750
As a consequence, also, of this lack of compositionality,
we cannot, as previously in mathematics, name

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,420
arbitrary well-formed smaller parts.

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,320
So, we cannot write the
previous example like that.

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,630
Previously, you had this loop: while something
... and then we had this code block.

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:40,250
And we cannot really, in most imperative languages,
give a name to this code block, and then simply

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,350
mention the name here.

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,460
Because this is not an expression.

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:51,320
So, in C or Java, or Python, the things that
you would consider expressions are the things

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,510
that you can write on the right-hand
side of an assignment statement.

00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,320
And something like this is not
something that you could write.

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,790
Because this block is not an expression.

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,790
It doesn't have a value.

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,500
It doesn't have a meaningful type, etc.

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,640
You could try some workarounds.

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,010
You could use functions, procedures, methods,
depending on the specific language that you're

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,360
trying to do this in.

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,920
So, you could try to introduce a new procedure
which, essentially, corresponds to this code

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,020
block here.

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,430
But even then, you don't get the same kind of
flexibility that we are used to from mathematics.

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:35,550
There, we can simply take some expression, give
it a name, and use notation and understand

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,760
notation in this spirit here.

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,490
So, what about the expressions that
do occur in C or Java or Python?

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,040
So, even if not everything is an expression,
at least we know that there are expressions

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,300
in these languages as well.

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,940
The things that occur on the right-hand
sides of an assignment command, for example.

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,710
What about those expressions?

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:07,260
Let's consider the sublanguage of only
expressions in something like C or Java.

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,620
Can they at least be treated as we saw before?

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,040
So, do we get back our mathematical principles,
if we focus only on the expression part of

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,080
an imperative language?

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,880
Well, I claim here that it is not the case.

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Why is that?

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,730
Well, let's look at an example.

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:32,500
It is a bit convoluted here, but really corresponds
to something similar we saw before with concrete

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,970
numbers and constants.

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:40,510
So let's look at an expression like this, which
is built from expressions: "subexpression1

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,140
+ subexpression2 × (expression3)^2".

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,090
We saw that before with
constants and some "x + 1" here.

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,820
Mathematically, we know that there are three
equivalent ways of writing this piece of expressions.

00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:04,050
So, we could really say, for example, name
this expression with some variable name, and

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,730
simply square that variable.

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,840
Or we could say, squaring that variable is
the same as writing: "variable × variable".

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:17,590
Or, indeed, we could avoid naming the
subexpression, and simply repeat that subexpression

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,590
here.

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,630
So, "exp1 + exp2 × exp3 × exp3".

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:29,290
That should also be mathematically
equivalent to this piece of code.

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,680
But is it true?

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,190
In an imperative setting, if we have this,
for example, as the right-hand side of an

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:43,550
assignment statement, so the very same expression
as we had here, and then, for example, this

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,550
"naming a subexpression" could be
expressed in theory as saying:

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,040
Well, let's assign the value of
the subexpression to a variable.

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,880
(It should be in scope, of course.)

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,760
And then let's, in the spirit of this first
line here, for example, have this right-hand

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:09,200
side expression for our result assignment, in
which we square the value of that variable.

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:19,200
That looks like the step from this to this
line.

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:30,560
Or we could try the same
for these other two lines.

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,810
Is this a valid transformation
in C or Java or Python?

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,230
No, it is not.

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:46,120
Let us consider these four lines here.

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:54,440
Each of them corresponds to one of the hypothetical
reformulations of the expression that we saw

00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,020
on the previous slide, on the mathematical
level.

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:05,760
And now, we can try them out in an imperative
language, and see whether they behave the

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
same.

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,791
In the sense that in any larger program, I
could replace a line like this with a line

00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:20,379
like this, or this, or this, and see
whether I have the same program behavior.

00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:26,860
And if you try this out, you will find out
that, actually, from those four, only the

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,100
second and third lines will
really behave the same.

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:41,080
Whichever other pair of lines you pick, you
will be able to choose expressions, and maybe

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,670
variable values that are used in those expressions,
or function calls that are occurring in these

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:54,390
expressions, and replaced by or tied to specific
implementations of procedures and functions,

00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:00,340
and you will be able to observe differences.

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,129
The way of convincing yourself of that would
be to replace exp3 (the expression that

00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:12,960
we wanted to give a name to), and then
reuse, for example, in these lines here:

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,879
Imagine that exp3 is the so-called expression
"i++", which isn't really an expression.

00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,960
It is really a statement.

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:30,520
It is a command to increment the value of
the variable i, which should be in the scope

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
somehow.

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,750
And, for example, if you look at the first
line and the last line, then you will see

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,940
that here the "i" will be incremented once,
and here the "i" will be incremented twice.

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,700
Which is already an observable difference
from the outset of this expression or these

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
small program parts.

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,269
So, they are not interchangeable.

00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,789
And the same applies to other pairs.

00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:59,289
Or, you don't need to have state manipulations,
you don't need to have an update of a variable.

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:05,669
You could simply have a function call to something
which, ostensibly, is a function, but actually

00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,880
is not a function in a mathematical sense.

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,159
A procedure in your language which
might alter some global state.

00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,779
It might be a method that you call on an object,
and it changes instance variables of the object.

00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:27,070
Then again, taking this first line and the last
line, you will be able to observe differences.

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:34,299
Or f is a procedure that does input/output
as in the "print" or "read" examples that

00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,480
I discussed in a previous video.

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,350
Again, things will simply change the semantics.

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,260
And that is because what we see
here are not pure expressions.

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,600
Because in an imperative language,
we don't have pure expressions.

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,940
We have these expressions
which have a side effect.

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,610
Which are really commands.

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,309
So, we cannot name parts of
expressions arbitrarily or freely.

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,539
This is really the underlying problem here.

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:11,690
That even the sublanguage of expressions in an
imperative language is not expression-based,

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,750
in the sense of mathematical expressions.

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:20,071
So, despite these lines here originating from
seemingly mathematical equivalences, they

00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:25,259
are not program equivalences.

00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:32,870
And for the same reason, for example, reevaluating
an expression can lead to different values.

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,889
Or the order of evaluating subexpressions
becomes relevant, because we don't really

00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:38,889
have functions.

00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:44,750
A mathematical function would be where whenever
you call the function with the same input,

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,970
you get the same output.

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,899
But for a procedure, for a method in an imperative
language, that is not necessarily the case.

00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,690
You only have to think about the
'read' function/method/procedure.

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,780
You can call it 10 times, and
you can get 10 different results.

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:09,139
That clearly runs counter to any argument
about the equivalence of syntactic expressions.

00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:19,049
A natural question now is: How bad is this?

00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,070
Or is it bad at all?

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:27,980
I have shown you quite artificial examples
that demonstrate that in a typically impure,

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,480
imperative language, you cannot characterize
expressions or subexpressions by their value.

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,860
So, we don't have properties
that we know from mathematics.

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,620
Where we can name subexpressions in a term.

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,639
Where we can rearrange expressions.

00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:52,860
Where we can replace each expression by
another expression, if it has the same value.

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,429
So all these properties, also often called
"referential transparency", do not apply in

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:02,809
a typical impure language with side effects.

00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:04,450
But does that prove anything?

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,680
So, should we bother?

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,159
Well, at the moment that is not really the
point.

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,340
I haven't yet argued that the pure
expression-based style is better in some sense.

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:24,010
The argument that I have been making, what
is hopefully clear now (or should become more

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,820
and more clear), is that these
two styles are different.

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,370
Whether one of them is better
is a different question.

00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:38,090
But this observation, that things we are used
to from mathematics and from algebra, from

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:44,950
transforming formulas, are not directly applicable
to impure programs in an imperative language.

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,970
That is something which really separates it
from mathematics or from a mathematical style

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,760
of programming (which both functional and
also logic programming will largely be about).

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:03,110
At the moment, what I wanted to convey is
this difference, not a notion of "better".

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,010
That is really the motivation for this course.

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,740
While this was, on the other
hand, also quite abstract.

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:22,100
So, my plan is that I will again, beside the
slides here, make some additional video or

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
videos.

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:29,690
Probably one on the whiteboard again, discussing
some of the compositionality aspects I mentioned

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,459
earlier, and then also again
an example in CodeWorld.
