00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Okay, let's talk about negation in Prolog today.

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,680
And well, actually, negation did
already occur in some example programs.

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,320
But it was always a bit mysterious.

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,600
So, I was making comments like, if you use
negation, you should make sure that it appears

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,360
at the end of your program clauses without
really explaining why that is important.

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,440
That's what this short part
or video here is about.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,360
I couldn't explain this before.

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
Because actually, it depends
on the operational reading

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,320
of Prolog programs that we
have recently introduced.

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
So, now it's time to talk about this.

97 # slide
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
So, the first thing to be aware
of is that logic programming

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,400
is, foremost, based on a positive logic.

00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,160
And a positive reading of the rules
that we have written into the program.

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
Yes, so we're trying to prove
some literal, some queries given.

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,920
And you want to prove or establish
a solution for this query.

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,080
Then we try to derive it from known facts
or looking at it backwards, we try to derive

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,760
or to reduce this literal to the validity
of known facts by using resolution steps.

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,640
That's what resolution and the
derivation trees are about.

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Okay, so they use the clauses, the program
rules like if this and this and this and then

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,080
the following holds in a positive sense to
derive interesting stuff from known facts.

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Okay, so the rules are establishing positive
knowledge from given positive knowledge.

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:58,000
So, apparently, something special then has
to happen if we want to have negation.

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,080
Okay, so Prolog has negation
as a syntactic construct.

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
However, this negation is not fully
compatible with the expected logical

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
meaning that we'll see in a moment
or why this is not fully compatible.

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:21,200
Syntactically, negation can be introduced either
by this operator, which is meant to be the not

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,680
symbol, or actually an operator directly, which is
called not, and then in brackets we have the Goal.

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Okay, and what is the reading here?

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,480
The reading is something like this,

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
or this, which is really just two
syntactic ways to write the same thing.

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,880
It is provable if and only if
the Goal itself is not provable.

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
Okay, this might, at first
glance look like a reasonable,

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,560
and maybe also expected logical meaning.

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,240
But that's not actually how we think
about negation when we reason logically.

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,480
We say the negation of something
is true if that something is false.

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
Yes, if you want to know that

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,760
the negation of Goal holds, then we should
actually establish and prove that Goal is false.

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,680
But that's not what's happening here.

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,240
What's happening here is, if I cannot prove that
Goal is true, then I accept that not Goal is true.

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,120
Yes, so it's not necessary to prove the negation
of something to know that, indeed, it is false.

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,440
But instead, what's said here or what Prolog says
is, if I cannot prove that something is true,

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
then I might as well assume
that the negation of it is true.

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
And that's not how we in common sense and
everyday reasoning think about negation.

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Just because I cannot prove that something holds,

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
I may not simply assume that
the negation of it holds.

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,440
Yes, that would somehow shift the burden of
proving something or the negation of it to

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,280
somebody who shouldn't be responsible for it.

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,160
So, if I want to claim that something is
false, then I should prove that it is false.

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,720
I shouldn't simply say, well,
I tried to prove it is true.

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,520
I failed.

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,360
So, from now on, I claim that it is false.

00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Yes, it's somehow abandoning my
obligation of proving what I'm claiming.

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
But Prolog uses exactly this approach.

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,680
Okay, in some ways, in some cases it works okay.

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,080
Yes.

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
So, let's say we have a predicate, and that's
actually a predefined predicate in Prolog

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,400
for checking whether an element,
well, any term is in a list.

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Then we can ask a negated question.

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,880
We can ask, is it true that not 4

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
is a member of the list [2,3],
and indeed it is provable.

00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,600
Why?

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
Well, Prolog will try to prove that
4 is a member of the list [2,3].

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,400
Prolog will fail with this.

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,200
And actually, it will fail in a finite way.

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,520
We'll have to think in a moment about why it's
important that this is a finite failure tree,

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,600
so, that's the kind of derivation tree
that we have seen in the previous video.

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,120
But here, we want to have a failure tree that is a
tree, which doesn't have any successful leaf node.

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Okay, and if this is the case, and
it will be a case for the query,

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,960
whether 4 is a member of [2,3].

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
So, this is not true.

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,800
Well, because there is a finite failure tree, a
finite tree where every leaf node is a failure.

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
And then Prolog will say, well,

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,200
since the query whether 4 is a member
of the list [2,3] is not provable.

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,480
I may as well say that, indeed,
4 is not a member of [2,3].

00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,600
And in this case, that's well, probably

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,320
good enough as a strategy for
proving this negative query.

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
Okay, however, in all situations, you have to be

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,080
more careful, or the
interpretation might be surprising.

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
In particular, when variables are involved.

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,280
So, let's look at a slightly
similar but a bit different query.

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
Namely, where we have a variable here.

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
And let's actually ask Prolog,

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,880
whether there is something which
is an element of the list [2,3]?

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,040
Then, well, Prolog will say yes,
2 is a solution for this query,

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
and 3 is a solution for this query.

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
Okay, that's good enough.

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,240
That's also true.

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,640
We may ask now, is it not the case
that X is an element of [2,3]?

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,400
And then we might have expected
to get the answer 4 here.

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,360
Right?

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
So, asking, you could read this as asking
for an X, which is not a member of [2,3].

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,200
And we know that, for example,
4 is not a member of [2,3].

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,800
However, Prolog will not
answer with X = 4 here.

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
Instead, Prolog will say false.

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,920
Yes, so Prolog will basically say, I cannot
prove that X is not an element of [2,3].

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,760
Or, I cannot prove that there
is no element of the list [2,3].

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,120
Yes, so this is in slight conflict to this here.

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
So, 4 is not a member of [2,3].

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
But if I asked with a
variable, I don't get X = 4.

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,480
I get false.

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Also, if I negate this again, then I
don't get back to the original behavior.

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Yes.

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,200
So, in normal logical reasoning, you would
say not, not of something is that something.

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,600
But well, you can actually negate this again.

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,520
So, if I ask
"not (not (member X of list [2,3]))",

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,680
then you might expect that it's the
same as asking X member of list [2,3].

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,600
So, you would expect to get the
X = 2 or X = 3.

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,280
But instead, Prolog will simply say, yes, true.

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,840
But won't give you any results.

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,040
Yes, because basically, this will
be the negation of this line,

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,760
but information about which particular X answers
who are members of the list [2,3] will be lost.

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,720
Or in other words, negation does
not yield variable bindings.

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes, with negation you get false or
true, but you don't get concrete results

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,200
for any variables that
occur in the negated calls.

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,800
And that's already strange that this
is not behaving the same as this line.

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:40,320
So, double negation apparently doesn't cancel out
as you would expect from normal logical reasoning.

98 # slide
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,080
So, what is the role of
finite failure trees here?

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,520
Well, it's these two points here coming together.

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
For on the one hand, we cannot

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,840
show that from the clauses of a program,
certain negative statements follow.

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,520
Exactly, because the rules are all positive.

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,920
So, we never have a negated
literal in the head of a rule.

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
If this and this and this,
then the following holds.

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,520
And even though we might use negation

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,120
on the right-hand side of a rule, we
never use negation in the head of rules.

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,560
We have never something like a rule that
establishes that something is wrong.

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,400
We only derive positive stuff.

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,520
Okay, so, the only choice we have, as I
said on the previous slide, is exactly what

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Prolog is doing, it basically is saying,
well, I tried to prove a positive thing.

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
I couldn't deduce this other thing.

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
So, then I will assume that it is wrong.

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
So, negation-as-failure.

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,040
Failure to establish something positive is
taken as negation of that positive thing.

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
Okay, so that means we have to have a notion

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,840
of not being able to produce something,
not being able to deduce something.

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Okay, now what does this mean?

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,680
We show that it cannot be deduced.

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,960
Well, it basically means we try hard and fail.

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah, we attempt to prove a
positive statement, but we fail.

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
Now, of course, then the question
is, well, have you tried hard enough?

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,760
Well, actually, in order to accept this
negation-as-failure principle, we should at least say,

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,800
well, if I said I tried to prove a positive thing
and I have really tried everything there is.

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,080
Yes, I didn't just overlook some
part or was lazy in proving.

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,600
No, I should have exhaustively tried
to prove the positive statement.

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
And how can I try something exhaustively?

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,520
Well, only if it's finite?

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,680
Yes.

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,480
So, in order to be sure that any attempt at
proving the positive thing will definitely fail.

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,080
Well, this can only be said with certainty,
if really the search space was finite.

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,520
If there was a finite space in which I
could try to prove the positive thing,

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,840
and exhausted all of that finite space;

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,800
and then failed to prove the positive thing; only
then will I accept: well, then the negation holds.

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,400
Then I claim from now on that the negation holds.

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,680
So, that's the bare minimum in order to
accept this negation-as-failure principle.

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
Okay, that's exactly how
negation works in Prolog.

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,160
What's underlying all this, of course, is a very
narrow-minded view of the world, if you like.

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,120
Well, it's also called the
closed world assumption.

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,840
Because it really says: well,

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,200
I take the Prolog program that somebody
has written as all the knowledge there is.

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,480
Yes.

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,680
So, everything that can be
deduced from the rules is true.

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,840
But everything else will be false.

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,440
Yes, I only accept things as true that
are explicitly derivable from the program.

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
Everything else is automatically false.

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
So, the program is taken
to describe a closed world.

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,840
And everything which can't
be followed from the program

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,280
is simply claimed to be wrong, to be false.

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,200
Okay, that's not how our world actually works.

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,880
But that's how Prolog makes sense of the
world with this closed world assumption.

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,680
(5 sec.)

99 # slide
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Let's look at some short examples, artificial
examples that are only here in order to

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,640
explore this finite search aspect. Also, these are
still examples without variables, even though I

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,840
just said two slides ago, that there's
interesting behavior when variables are involved.

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,920
But this will happen on another slide.

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,280
So, let's first look at some
artificial examples without variables.

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,360
And indeed, let's look at this
very simple, very stupid program,

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
where we simply say p follows from p.

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
Yes, it's not very useful,
because there is no base fact.

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,920
But, of course, it's a valid Prolog program.

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,000
Then I could, for example,
ask whether or not p holds.

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
Yes, I ask the question not-p.

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
And I only have the knowledge
that p follows from p.

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,960
Okay, what will happen?

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, if I run this then I will
run into an infinite behavior.

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
So, I will have to abort this.

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
So, by pressing Ctrl C, or something like that.

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,240
Otherwise, or maybe there is a built-in timeout
in the interpreter, then this will also abort.

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,320
Because otherwise, there
would be infinite search.

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Why is that?

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Well, how does this behave?

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,280
How is it executed?

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,320
Well, let's look at this
in derivation tree style.

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,520
So, let's say it is our root query \+ p.

00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,240
Then what Prolog will do under the closed
world assumption is negation-of-failure.

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
It will say, well, if I'm asked whether or
not p holds, I will actually try to prove p.

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,960
And if I fail to do this and I have
exhausted all possibilities and still fail,

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,520
then I will say, well, then \+ p is true.

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Okay.

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,120
So, what will happen here is that there will be
a kind of side branch where Prolog tries to prove

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
the p, which is negated here.

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,280
Okay, and well, will this entail?

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,120
Well, this means that we try to apply this rule.

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
Because it's the only rule with p in the program.

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,200
So, what does it do?

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Well, it is replaced by a resolution step.

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,320
It replaces this p by the right-hand side of
this rule, which is again p and again and again.

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,840
Yes, so there is no success here.

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,800
But it's not a finite failure tree.

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,600
Because I can infinitely often try to find a
next step here by blindly applying this rule.

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,080
So, while there is no success here,

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,000
it's also not a finite failure tree.

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,840
So, I basically never come back to
draw a conclusion about the \+ p.

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,720
Even though there is no success here.

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,840
I will still not be able to say that the
negation of p, whether it's true or false.

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,680
Because there's an infinite search going on here.

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,360
Okay, a stupid program, but
that's exactly what will happen.

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Okay, now a slightly bigger program.

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,760
But not much more practically relevant.

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,000
But for the sake of the example here,
let's say we have a program, which

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
has a somewhat similar idea, but
for q, we have a base fact for q.

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
And we have q follows from q, and we have

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,360
another predicate p, of which we know
that it holds if q does not hold.

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,400
And our actual query is the negation of p.

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
So, there is, again, some
kind of double negation.

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,440
The query is \+ p and p is \+ q
and for q, we have some rules.

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
Okay, how will this now turn out?

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
So, let's say we ask this.

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,800
So, this will give us true
and in a finite manner.

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,760
So, it will really give an answer and
will actually say that \+ p is true.

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,120
So, why is that?

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,680
Well, let's see.

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,920
Let's say this is our query, then again, in a kind
of side branch Prolog will try to establish p.

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
What will it do for this?

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
Well, p has only one rule.

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,760
So, resolution will mean to
reduce to the query \+ q.

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
Okay, so then we are here.

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,960
What will happen?

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,840
Well, Prolog will again,
say, well, if I'm asked to

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,120
investigate \+ q, I will actually try
to prove q and depending on whether this

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,240
is successful or not, I will make
a decision about the negation of q.

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,200
So, again, in a side branch,
Prolog will investigate q.

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Well, what holds for q?

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,240
Well, q is actually, there is a fact for q.

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,960
So, there is a very direct success node.

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,440
But of course, there are also similar,
infinite branches like here, right?

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,480
So, because q can also be reduced to q,
and this q could then again be successful.

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,760
But there's also this infinite branch.

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,560
There's also an infinite search tree behind here.

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,240
But actually, Prolog will not
run into this infinite search.

00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:25,200
Because to say that \+ q is false, it's
enough to establish that q has a solution.

00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
So, actually, in the case here,

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,320
after this first success for q, Prolog will
not even try to establish anything more.

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,680
Because one successful branch
for q suffices to let \+ q fail.

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
Yes, we said negation-as-failure.

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,450
If we fail to reduce q and fail in
a finite way, this was infinite.

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,000
But if you fail in the finite way,
then we might say that not q is true.

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,920
If we have success in establishing q,
then of course, immediately \+ q is false.

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:09,040
So, this means that because we have one success
here, the negation of q fails, is false.

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,840
And this now means that this whole
thing here is a finite failure tree.

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,360
Because with this part here, there is no
other thing to find as an alternative.

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,560
So, this has failed now.

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,600
Because of this side branch
succeeding, this has failed.

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,160
So, this overall is a finite failure tree for p.

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,640
And this in turn means that
\+ p is to be taken as true.

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
That's why we have this true answer here.

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,240
So, maybe it takes a bit of thinking about these
two cases, but they are really consistent with this

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,120
negation-as-failure and closed world assumption and
the necessity to have a finite failure in order

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,840
to establish that the negation of
something is to be taken as true.

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,120
To establish that the negation of
something is to be taken as false.

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,120
It's enough to have one success
for the thing that was negated.

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,840
That's what happened here.

100 # slide
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,480
Now, examples with variables.

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
And actually, I'm coming back
to the Pulp Fiction example.

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,280
So, we had something very similar to this in
the very first week of the Prolog part, I think.

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,800
Not exactly these rules.

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,320
So, these are in some cases a
bit simplified, but also made so

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,400
as to stress the role of negation
and where to put negated facts.

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,360
So, exactly this will be an example where we
will see why it's important to have negated

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,080
literals at the end of queries.

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
So, let's look, what do we have?

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,640
We have our three persons that were also
persons set in the previous example.

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
And then we have now.

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,200
So, they are not only in love
now, they are actually married,

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
particularly these two people
are married in both ways.

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
So, that's symmetric.

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,680
And we have a predicate defining that somebody
is single, namely, well: it's a person,

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,120
and is not married to somebody.

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,840
Okay, so, that's probably a reasonable
way to think about this concept.

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,920
Okay, then we can ask questions involving this.

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,560
We will prefer negated
occurrences of this predicate.

00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,480
So, we can, for example, ask whether
somebody is single and, well,

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,680
Marsellus is single because
Marsellus is not married, right?

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Yes, Vincent and Mia are married.

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
But Marsellus is not.

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
So, Marsellus is single.

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,680
Then we can also ask whether Marsellus is single.

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,800
And the answer will be true.

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
Very consistent with the query: Who is single?

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
The answer is Marsellus.

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,200
If I ask, is Marsellus single?

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,160
The answer is also true.

00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,360
So, very consistent.

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,960
And if I asked the same about Vincent
or Mia, the answer will be false.

00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
Okay, very reasonable.

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,560
Now, sometimes maybe unreasonable behavior happens
when we indeed change the order of these two

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
literals here.

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,400
Yes, so this is almost the same
program, it has the very same facts,

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
it has almost the same rule here.

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,360
I only switched the order of
these two program literals.

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,640
And from a purely logical
perspective, one might say,

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
well, this shouldn't make a difference, right?

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
Because this comma basically is conjunction.

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,360
And the conjunction and is
usually taken to be commutative,

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
which shouldn't matter whether I asked
the question this way or this way.

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,280
However, if you actually run it
then we might be in for a surprise.

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,240
Because what will happen?

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,560
Well, surprisingly, if I now asked whether
somebody is single, the answer would be false.

00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,480
Whereas here the answer was Marsellus.

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,600
Okay, that's strange already.

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
Then what's also strange

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,360
is that, well, if I asked whether Marsellus
is single, the answer is still true.

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,080
Well, this is okay.

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
Because here we had true as well.

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,560
But of course, this is in contradiction.

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,440
Yes.

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
If I ask, is there somebody who is single?

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,720
The answer is false.

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,200
No.

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,560
If I asked, is Marsellus single?

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,360
The answer is true.

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,400
Then, of course, I would have expected
also here the answer X = marsellus.

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,160
So, this is a contradiction
between these two answers.

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,520
Even if I ignore whatever this
program up here was doing.

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
This is already very strange.

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Okay.

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,840
And if I ask about Vincent.

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,160
And the answer is still as before.

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,280
Okay, so, this is okay.

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
But here something strange is going on.

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
And the question, of course, is why is that?

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
And how can you answer this?

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,880
Well, we should look at the derivation trees.

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
And we see what happens in
terms of finite failure.

101 # slide
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
So, let's add to the program
which was well-behaving.

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,280
The program where we put the negated
literal at the end of our program clause,

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,440
which is what I advise to always do.

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,840
So, this is a program that follows my advice.

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
What happens if I asked
about people who are single?

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Well, let's simply build a derivation tree.

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,680
So, a single of x can only be
resolved with this program clause

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,480
by basically replacing this with the body.

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Let me actually follow my other
advice to always rename the variables.

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
So, that we don't get any mix-ups.

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,920
So, let's say I rename X and Y to
X1 and Y1 in this program rule.

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,640
And the unification and resolution step.

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,360
What will happen?

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,360
Well, then this will unify and I will get
this right-hand side where I have replaced the

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,720
X and Y with X1 and Y1.

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,080
And I remember that this X from the original
query is from now on to be taken as the X1.

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,040
Okay, so there is this simply
straightforward resolution.

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Okay, what happens then?

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,200
Well, we have this human of X1
as the next literal to deal with.

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,080
And there are several candidate
facts to resolve this with.

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,160
So, one is, of course, this
where X1 becomes Marsellus.

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,240
And that's also the first thing to try because
human(marsellus) is the first fact in the program.

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,080
And then this means that this will disappear.

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,640
We remember X1 is now marsellus.

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,360
And we are left with the rest of the query where
of course, X1 is also replaced by marsellus.

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,680
So, we have this as the new query.

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,840
There are also two other branches for these two.

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,560
And these two facts as well, but let's
not focus on them for the moment.

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,280
Because we always do this
step first, left to right.

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,680
So, we will first definitely investigate this.

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
Okay, what will this entail?

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,080
Well, there is now a negated query.

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,400
So, we should solve this in a side branch.

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,880
So, we try to establish this to then make a
conclusion about whether or not the negated

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,400
version should be taken to be true or false.

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,560
Okay, so, we ask, is there a Y1 such
that Marsellus is married to this person?

00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,800
And well, we can directly see that there's
nothing here which would unify with this literal.

00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,840
So, this fails.

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
And fails immediately in a finite way.

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,240
Because there's no step to take.

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,200
And then, well, that's a classic
case of negation-as-failure.

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
We tried to establish this.

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
We failed in finite time.

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,240
So, we have exhaustively tried but failed.

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
Then we can say, well, then the negation is true.

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,880
Okay, then we have a success node.

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
And well, what about our
X from the original query?

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,440
Well, we have a solution for this.

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
X is X1, X1 is marsellus.

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,800
So, this is the answer.

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,920
Yes, I mentioned that there's no
variable bindings inside negation.

00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,840
But this only means that the
Y1 doesn't get an answer here.

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
But it doesn't hurt us here.

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,200
Because we were asked about the X and for
the X, we have via X1 the solution Marsellus.

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,880
So, this is our answer.

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,240
Okay, and if you were to
investigate these two further

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
branches, we would not find any further solution.

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:38,240
Because actually, both X1 = vincent and X1 = mia
would not indicate that the negation is true.

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,040
Because indeed, for both of them, there
is a Y1 to which they are married.

102 # slide
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,960
Okay, what about the other program where we
have not followed the advice of putting negated

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
literals last, so when we have
actually first the negated literal

00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,440
and then the other one?

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,960
What happens then?

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
Well, we saw what happens.

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
But let's investigate why it happens.

00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,040
So, the point was that for this program,
we asked whether there are singles.

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,560
The answer was no.

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Yes, so Marsellus wasn't found as single.

00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,600
Why is that?

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
Well, let's do the derivation tree for single(X).

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Well, of course, this again will
be resolved with this last rule.

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,560
So, the first step is just as
before, except that, of course,

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,480
also here now the order of these two
literals is the other way around.

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,920
But we still remember X is X1
and here we have the same two

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,840
literals as before, just in the other order.

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,040
Okay, this new order, of course, now means
that if we do this from left to right here,

00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,640
we will now focus on this literal
as before on the previous slide.

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
But we'll directly work with this.

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,280
And working with this since it's
a negated literal means that we

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,200
have a side branch in which we try
to establish the positive thing.

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,880
married(X1,Y1).

00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,240
Okay.

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,160
So, the side branch now is this.

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,840
Okay.

00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,560
Differently than from the previous
example, from the previous slide,

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,720
where we simply first dealt with this and found
an instantiation for X1, namely, marsellus.

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,840
We had Marsellus here.

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,680
Now we have (X1,Y1).

00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,800
Okay, what does this mean?

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Well, we try to work with this.

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,040
Actually, we want to fail in order to
make the negation positive or if we

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,200
succeed with this tree, then the negation
will be taken to be false, to be failed.

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,360
Yes.

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,920
And again, not the thing that was negated
failed, but the negation itself failed.

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,160
Okay, so there is a side branch
married(X1,Y1), normal resolution.

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,560
Well, there are two rules
or facts to work with here.

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,800
This one and this one.

00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,080
Yes, these are two instantiations
where we get a success node.

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,440
But as I mentioned before, if
we are in such a side branch,

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,000
then one success kills all the others.

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,840
So, as soon as there is one success, we
will say that the negated thing is false.

00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Yes.
Because the thing that you want to negate

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,280
has a success, and then we don't
need to explore alternatives.

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,880
You need to explore the alternatives if

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,560
you're looking for when we want to
arrive at a finite failure tree.

00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,240
But this is a finite success
tree, where there is one success.

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,960
That's enough to say, well,
married(X1,Y1) is false.

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,160
And if this is false, the
whole query will be false.

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,400
That's why there was no answer for X.

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,920
So, this actually fails.

00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,240
Because the thing that you want to
negate has at least one solution.

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,760
Different from the previous slide.

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,200
And also, different from the next slide,

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,840
where we will look at the case where I run, for
this program, the query where X is marsellus.

103 # slide
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,560
So, let's again take this program where
we have to negate that subquery first.

00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,880
But now we are asking without variables.

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
So, now our query is really
asking, well, is Marsellus single?

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
Okay, what will happen?

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,080
Well, for the first step, of course,
is resolution with this clause.

00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,080
So, now, X1 will directly become
marsellus via unification.

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,480
And of course, in our query, we
also have marsellus here and here.

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,580
Okay.

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,840
Next, we will look at this.

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Because it's the first
literal in our current query.

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,320
And since it's a negation, that means to
investigate the negated thing in a side branch.

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
So, married(marsellus,Y1).

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,240
We have seen something similar to this before.

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,960
Namely, this will fail because there's no
way to unify it with either this or this.

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,640
So, this fails.

00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,360
That's a finite failure tree.

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,240
So, the negated thing is taken to be true.

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,920
Yes, we tried to establish the
thing that was negated; this failed.

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,720
And why a negation-as-failure, this
means the negation is taken to be true.

00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,800
Okay, so this actually is resolved.

00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,200
So, we are left with the rest of the
query, which is human(marsellus).

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,600
And well, this is something that we
know as a fact from the program.

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,560
So, actually, this will also be resolved
and we will get a success node.

00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,800
So, indeed, if we asked Prolog

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,800
if Marsellus is single, with this
program, the answer will be true.

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,320
Even though on the previous slide
asking for the same program,

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,280
whether there is someone
single, the answer was no.

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay, so it's really valuable to compare in
detail this slide with the previous slide.

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,240
And then also both of the slides even before that,
where we looked at the opposite order of these two

00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,040
literals here.

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,880
So, by looking at these three cases, and
really understanding what's going on,

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,400
you should get a very good idea and
understanding of how Prolog negation works.

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:18,640
And why and where the advice came
from, that I gave that in the program

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:27,840
you should, if you have to use negation,
put it at the end of your clauses.

104 # slide
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,280
We can also try to understand from more
of a logic perspective, by trying to

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,560
translate our relevant program
clauses into logical formulas.

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,080
We haven't done this systematically,
but at least we have

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,640
at some point talked about how this
reading could work without negation.

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,360
So, let's look at this now
in the context of negation.

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,560
And only for this example, actually by its
principle transferable to our case as well.

00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,720
And let's do this on another assumption
that where we ask our query with x unbound.

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,240
That was really where something strange
happened also on the previous slides.

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,640
And also, that if we
have a query or a literal,

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,560
human(X), then this will instantiate the X.

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,600
That was exactly what's
happened in the examples, right?

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,000
Because we had this base X for human.

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,160
Okay, so let's say X is unbound.

00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,240
But if you have human(X), then this
will give concrete values for X.

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,880
Then this version of the program
clause can be read as follows.

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,880
So, it's saying for all X,
because X is originally unbound.

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,560
For all X, something holds, namely, the
right-hand side implies the left-hand side.

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,360
And what's the right-hand side?

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,760
Well, it is a conjunction of two things.

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,600
And the first thing is to have
human(X); yes, for all X holds.

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,800
If human(X) and something
else holds, then X is single.

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,720
And what's this something else that should hold?

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
Well, it's a negation.

00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,680
And inside the negation, there
is a free variable, the Y.

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,960
The X is not free here.

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,600
Because human(X) will actually
bind the X to something.

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
To Marsellus, Mia, or Vincent.

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,560
Alright, so if we have the
negation here, we are asking

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,320
not married of some concrete X and an unknown Y.

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,560
And this unknown Y is a free variable.

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,320
That's the standard interpretation
of free variables in Prolog.

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
That's basically an existential quantification.

00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,840
So, it's asking well, for all X, if X is human,
and there is no Y such that X is married to Y.

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,880
Then X is single.

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,800
And that's exactly how we think about
these concepts, their connection, okay.

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,880
And that's why this program
clause behaves as expected.

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,800
In contrast, if we have the
other order, yes, in this way.

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,840
Then what will happen?

00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:56,480
Well, the point now is that when we look at
this part, the first part of the conjunction,

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,280
now both X and Y are free variables.

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,440
Because the X hasn't yet been bound.

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,880
If we call this with an unbound variable
X, then X is also a free variable.

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,120
So, when we have something like this, then the
negation of married(X, Y) is actually asking,

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,800
there aren't X and Y such
that X and Y are married.

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,960
Okay, and only afterwards, the X that
occurred in the query is instantiated by

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,840
asking or by saying that this human.

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,320
Okay, so the point is, this
X here is a free variable.

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,800
So, it's existentially quantified,

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,080
it's not yet bound to some specific
human, to some specific person.

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,000
That's why this will in the logical

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,040
reading conflate to not exist X,
Y such that they are married.

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,640
Okay, this must be true, and it
must be true that X is human,

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
then we will be able to deduce that X is single.

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,840
And well, this is not a useful
concept of being single.

00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:06,720
Because this is, well, misinterpreted
by this X still being a free variable.

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,160
Because by the rules of formal logic, this
X, which is existentially quantified here,

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,720
and then negated doesn't need to have anything
to do with this outer axiom, or with this axiom.

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,960
This is simply not what we meant
when we described being single.

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,040
That's what we meant.

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,440
And that's what we get if we put our negated
literal late in the query, late in the

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,440
right-hand side of our clause to give

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,680
the X a chance to first be instantiated by
some other literals occurring in the code.

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,120
That's then giving the desired reading.

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,520
And this one isn't.

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,360
Okay, so that's what also explains what
happened on the previous slide, but not

00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:07,840
with this operational reading, but by finding
reasonably similar formal logic expressions.

105 # slide
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,440
Okay, as a summary on this part about negation,

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,280
let's conclude well, it's
not real logical negation.

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,480
Yes, it has this negation-as-failure flavor.

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,920
And that's not what usually negation in logic is.

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,560
we simply have to accept this that Prolog doesn't
establish or provide a real logical negation.

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
Instead, there is the
negation-as-failure concept,

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,600
which is often good enough, which is useful in
many programs, but it's not real logical negation.

00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,400
We have seen in what sense it is not.

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,080
Because, for example, it doesn't satisfy

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,960
properties like double negation being
the same as the original literal.

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,680
Okay, and all these strange
behaviors with or without variables.

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,120
Okay, how is it realized?

00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,080
Well, by proof search in this side branch.

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,200
Yes, we ask about the negated literal,
then we actually try in a side branch to

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,720
find the proof for the thing that is negated.

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,160
And depending on what happens in
the side branch, we will decide

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,040
what is true about the negated literal.

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Okay, and the side branch is not really a
side branch in that it doesn't influence,

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,040
it only tells us whether to consider
the negated literal true or false.

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,640
It doesn't otherwise influence
the main derivation tree.

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,160
In particular, by not binding
variables to the outside world.

00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
Whatever happens in this side branch

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,720
the answer is just whether it's
successful or a finite failure tree.

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,400
There's no communication or variable
bindings or solutions found in that

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
side branch into the main proof tree.

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,800
As we have seen in the
examples that we looked at.

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
Okay, it can only be truly understood
procedurally, operationally.

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,160
So, we have to think about that,
the important analysis in detail.

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,240
We have to think about the derivation trees.

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,920
Just as was the case for some other
properties of Prolog programs,

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,560
like determination questions, but
we also had to think operationally.

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,600
Plus, the declarative reading
of the Herbrand model

00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,760
wasn't enough for understanding
determination issues.

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,960
And it's also not enough
for understanding negation.

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,800
If we were to try this, then
we would have several problems.

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,640
So, trying to have a declarative perspective
with Herbrand model perspective well,

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,960
would immediately fail because of the "negation
failures" on the compositionality concept.

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,320
We have seen this with the thing
asking for single(marsellus).

00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,840
It was giving an answer, a positive answer, yes.

00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,400
But asking for single(X) didn't give an answer.

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
That defies the compositionality of queries.

00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,520
Okay.

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,720
We also saw that in the
presence of negation-as-failure.

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,840
The answers are sensitive
against changing the order.

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,320
Well, we saw that it's sensitive to
changes of the order inside rules.

00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,160
Yes, exchanging body literals.

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,840
But also, we could find
examples where the order

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,880
of the facts and rules in the
program affects the outcome.

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,000
And in the Herbrand
semantics, this didn't happen.

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,240
As the order was not important for
getting results with this Tp operator.

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,120
Okay, and mathematically, if we look at it,
we would find that this Tp operator that we

00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,480
used in the declarative semantics would not be
monotone in the presence of negation or failure.

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:54,560
In the sense that, well, giving it a bigger
set should always also get a bigger result set.

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,520
That was important for this fixed-point property.

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,720
So, iterating the key operator
beginning with the empty set,

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,360
and always getting bigger, bigger, bigger sets.

00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,720
So, that ultimately, we could say, the
fixed point or the limit, the ultimate

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,200
biggest set reached by this process is the
one which is the true meaning of the program.

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,400
This wouldn't work here because
of this negation concept.

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,120
This operator wouldn't be monotone in that
sense that we always get an increasing sequence.

00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:28,320
So, that wouldn't be a useful concept
of this fixed point being reached, okay.

00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,120
It would simply fail.

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:42,320
Okay, that's why we have to understand
negation in this operational fashion.
