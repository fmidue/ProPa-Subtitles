00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,280
Okay, let me make some observations
on variables and their use in Prolog.

00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,280
Some things we have already seen.

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,480
So, this is an example from
the end of the previous video.

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800
And what we saw there.

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,880
And I commented on this already is that, of
course, there is no somehow contradiction or

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:32,960
interference between a variable's usage in
the query here and in a rule in a program.

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,520
Right?

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,400
That we have X here and X here is not a problem,

00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,640
just as in Haskell or other
languages, variables have a scope.

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
And usually, the scope is for
example, over a function definition.

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
So, this X and Y are this X and Y.

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,040
And well, this X is completely different.

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,000
You could think of these X
and Y to be renamed to X′ and

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Y′ if you need to make sure that you
don't confuse that X with that X.

00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
But you don't have to do this,

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,040
that's handled by the runtime system,
just as in other languages as well.

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,680
Okay, so that's something
that's not new or surprising.

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,920
Also, it should go without saying,
or that's already been said,

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,120
that within one rule, or within one query, the
same variable represents the same object, right?

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
So, this Z and this Z are the same thing
because they are the same variable.

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Again, standard practice.

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,120
Okay.

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,760
Likewise, different variables may represent
but don't have to represent different objects.

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,960
Yeah, so that's why we had to add
this explicit constraint here.

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
Because if we didn't, then despite
the fact that we have X and Y here,

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,800
they could, of course, be the same
entity in a concrete instantiation.

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,280
Again, just like, if you have a functional
procedure in another language, and you have

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,040
two argument variables, even
though it's a different variable,

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,760
you could, of course, pass the
same way, the same argument.

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,720
Okay, so far, that's as expected,
but there are some subtleties.

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Some things are different in
Prolog than certainly in Haskell.

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,840
And probably also in other languages
that you have considered or seen.

00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
That's why these last two points are red.

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,960
Because they are something to really be aware
of, and to take care of, careful about.

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
So, this one, it's possible to have several
occurrences of the same variable in a rule's head.

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
We didn't have this here, we used X and Y.

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,960
But we could have used X and X here.

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,280
Okay, so we could have a rule of the form
"jealous(X,X)" under some conditions.

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,580
Okay.

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,800
And then, of course, they would, by this
interpretation, by this observation, then they

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,880
would really have to refer to the same object in
all invocations for this rule or fact or whatever.

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Okay, and now, this is really
different, for example, from Haskell.

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Actually, in the Haskell part, I had an explicit

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,520
discussion of this in some of their early
videos, that if you define a function like

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,360
f of some arguments, then you can't have a rule
of the form f of x and x equals something, right?

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
You can express this with guards
with expressing explicitly.

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
So, using two different variables

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
and then explicitly requesting the
values to be the same, et cetera.

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
But you can't write syntactically
f of x and x equals something.

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,760
And likewise, in other languages,
be it Python, be it Java, whatever,

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,400
if you define a procedure and you give
the signature or give the arguments,

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
then you are expected to use different variables.

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,720
You don't write f, or another name, and then an
x : Int and x : Bool or something like that.

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,480
Yes, you have to use different variable names.

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
In Prolog, not so,

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,560
you can actually use the same variable name
several times in the head of a rule, okay?

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,840
And we will have to see what this implies for
the evaluation, for example, for computing.

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,960
Okay, but it's syntactically allowed.

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, that's important.

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,640
And maybe at least it's surprising,
and at least it's important.

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
On the right-hand side of a rule, like here,

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,160
you can actually have variables
that do not occur in the head.

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,800
Again, that's something that's unusual in
Haskell, if you define f of x and y is something

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,040
equals something, then on the right-hand side, you
should only use things that are already in scope.

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,440
You can use x and y, of course, you can
use global values, global constants.

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,440
But you can't use a z that simply
appears at this point for the first time.

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
That would be very strange.

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,920
And likewise, in other languages, if you define a
procedure in Java, and it has arguments x and y,

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,480
then you can't somehow access an unknown
z from inside the body of that method.

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
You can have a local variable, but then
it has to be introduced at that point.

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,760
It's not something that somehow refers to
an unknown thing that's not even in scope.

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay?

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
And here, this looks like it
simply appears out of nothing.

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,480
So, we have to explain what this means.

00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,840
That's actually the topic of the next slide.

10 # slide
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
So, variables like that some sense occur out of

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
thin air are called free
variables in Prolog, right?

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,480
They are free in the sense that they are not
bound by the head here, or by anything else.

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,520
Just they simply appear in the right hand
of the rule and are not bound anywhere.

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
So, they are free.

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
Now, how should they be interpreted?

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,040
How should Z be interpreted in this case?

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,840
Or how should the whole rule be interpreted?

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,200
Okay, so, to think about this, we can
think about the logical interpretation.

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,080
So, this all, somehow these are
predicates, and we have variables.

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,200
So, in logic, you would think about
the quantifier for this variable.

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,960
So, somehow implicitly, at least there must be
some quantifier, which says that for all X, Y,

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,160
or "for all Z", or "exists Z" or whatever, so,
maybe some reasonable ideas to think about.

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
Well, how is this Z
introduced in a logical sense?

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
And there are different options.

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,520
And we have to know which
is the one that Prolog uses.

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
That will explain what role
free variables play.

00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,280
And we have, of course,

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,640
somehow from the previous example, or from
this example, as discussed previously already,

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,120
some idea what we want this to express to really
mean jealousy and then we will see that Prolog indeed

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
has exactly this interpretation.

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,640
But then this can be transferred
from this example to other cases.

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
Okay, so one way to think about
this way would be as follows.

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,320
So, let's say the X and Y, right, they
are bound when we call the "jealous"

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,080
predicate, we can say of course, they
are arbitrary or somehow quantified,

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
but for one specific
invocation then fixed, right?

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,600
So, we call "jealous" maybe
with Vincent, Marsellus, then

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,520
this rule applies for all X and Y, but for some
invocation they are then fixed to two arguments.

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Okay, then, what about the Z?

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
It should be introduced when we use this rule.

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,060
Well.

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,320
And one way to think about it would
be to say, well, let's quantify the Z.

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,120
Let's quantify it universally, so it's arbitrary.

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,680
It's free.

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,600
So, for every choice of Z something may hold.

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,760
And then that may be used as the
precondition for this rule, right?

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,960
From which something else is deduced.

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Because one way to think
about it would be to say,

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,800
well, if for every choice of
Z, because Z is free here.

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
If for every choice of Z,
the right-hand side holds.

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,800
So, loves(X, Z) and loves(Y, Z) and X is different
from Y, which are things that you could check.

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,480
Then also the head should hold.

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Right, so we say if, for all
choices of Z, we can establish this,

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
then we have also established the thing
we wanted to establish about X and Y.

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Okay, that's one possible interpretation.

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,640
There's another one could again say, well,

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
for arbitrary but fixed X
and Y, we take this approach.

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
So, something, again universally.

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,640
So, for every choice of Z. Because it's
free, we can choose everything we want.

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,800
If it is the case that the right-hand side holds.

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
So, if it's the case that X loves Z and
Y loves Z and X is different from Y,

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,440
then we also know that this head statement holds.

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,480
Okay, now a different thing to
convince yourself of, maybe you have to

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,200
think back to the logic interpretation,
or how quantifiers and implications

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,840
et cetera work in formal logic, is
this really saying something different?

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
Are these two different things?

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, it's technically if it's written, there
seems to be a slight difference in the sense that

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
in the order of the implication,
or the nesting of implication,

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,840
and the for-all quantifier, for every choice,
seems to be slightly different here and here.

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,560
But does it also make a difference in
terms of really what the statements mean?

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,760
So, of course, there are some rules
in logic where you can simply change

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
the order of operations.

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
And sometimes that doesn't even
change what the statement says.

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,040
And sometimes it does.

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,200
So, is there a difference between
these two interpretations?

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
Yes, unfortunately, or maybe not unfortunately.

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,560
But simply as a matter of
fact, there is a difference.

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,400
It's a difference to say, well, in order
to establish that X is jealous of Y,

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:17,760
we have to find out that for every choice of Z
this triangle holds or whether it is the case that

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,680
for every choice of Z if we establish this
part, then we already know that jealousy holds.

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,840
So, here we have to establish for Zs
and then we can make our deduction.

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,680
And here it says, well, for every
choice of Z we can make that deduction.

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,640
So, once we add a Z which establishes
this, then we can deduce what we have here.

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,000
So, which is the one that we use?

11 # slide
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
This is the one that we use.

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,280
The second one is how Prolog
interprets this, right?

00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:04,400
So, the for-all quantifier is in a
sense outside of the implication.

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:12,080
So, for all Z this implication was from this
follows that, that means once we have one Z

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,200
for which we can establish this, then
we can already deduce what we have here.

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
It's not the case that the for-all quantifier
somehow is implicitly on the right-hand side,

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,680
so that we have to establish for all Z this
holds, and only then we can establish this.

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
That's the logical difference.

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,760
So, if you need this spelled out more in detail,

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,880
then you can write down actually the formulas
that would correspond to these two states.

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,440
Then you also see that whether you
have the for-all inside or outside,

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,320
does make a logical difference for implication.

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,840
If you check it with the rules, for
example, from the logic lecture.

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,160
Okay, so that's the one
interpretation that you want to use.

12 # slide
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,840
And actually, it's logically
equivalent to a slightly different

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,800
formula or expression, which also
explains how we have used this so far.

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,000
So, if you again, indeed,
look at the formula rules of

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
predicate logic, for logic with variables, then
you can see that if you have something like this,

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,880
for every choice of Z it holds if
then this is logically equivalent.

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,280
Again, for arbitrary but fixed X, Y, to

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,760
a situation where indeed the
implication is, again, outside.

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,640
But the every has been switched to an any, right?

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
There's a logical equivalence between an
all-quantifier and an implication versus an

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:41,840
all-quantifier, an existential quantifier, and
an implication if the nesting has been changed.

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,040
Okay, so this is logically equivalent
to, if indeed, for any choice of Z,

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,240
the right-hand side holds
then also the head holds.

00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,080
So, you could see this either as an implicit for-all
quantifier on the outside of the rule, or as an

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,560
implicit existential quantifier on the inside,
namely, on the right-hand side of the rule.

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,880
Okay.

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,920
And that then corresponds to
our intuitive interpretation.

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,680
The way I talked about this example before,
namely, if there is somebody whom both X and

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,840
Y love where X and Y are different, then they are
jealous of each other, or at least X is jealous of Y.

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,800
And due to the symmetry of these rules,

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,920
actually, it will of these statements, of course, once
X is jealous of Y, also, Y would be jealous of X.

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
But that's not the point here.

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,280
The point is that, implicitly, we say
if you have a free variable like this,

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,120
the Z, then the interpretation
is if we could find a Z that

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,680
such that the right-hand side holds,
then the left-hand side holds.

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,400
Okay, so, there's an implicit existential
quantifier for the free variable

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,920
on the inside of the rule,
namely, on the precondition side.

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,640
That's important for understanding this program.

00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,760
But of course, generally,

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,960
transferring to all programs that you will
see where we use free variables like this.

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,440
And this is a very frequent feature to use
free variables of this style or in this style.

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
So, it's really important that
you get what is going on here.

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
And maybe on the formal side, why these
two things are equivalent, but mainly

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,840
how a free variable is interpreted.
