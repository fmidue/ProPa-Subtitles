1 # slide
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:06,180
Okay, welcome back to the
Programming Paradigms lecture.

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,509
Already from the layout and style of this
slide, you might guess and see that we are

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,440
entering a completely new chapter.

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,930
Indeed, we are leaving Haskell behind for
the lecture part, and are now considering

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,880
Prolog for the rest of the course in the lecture.

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,050
Okay, so this is the Prolog part, which was
announced early on, that the lecture will be

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,660
split into these two parts.

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:40,589
Also, obviously, this is the smaller
part of the course, mainly since we are

00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:43,820
now after nine lectures, and
we have fewer lectures left.

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:51,000
So, it's about 30% of the course. That
has in part to do with the following fact:

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,109
A lot of what we did in the Haskell part can
also be seen as inspiration for material in

00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,460
the Prolog part.

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,579
Yes, I mentioned in the beginning that one
big influence and big preparation for the

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:09,800
Prolog part, which is about logic programming,
is actually a course on logic, as most of

00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,720
you will have heard by Professor
König, or maybe elsewhere.

00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,060
But mainly, I guess, the lecture by Professor
König will be your logic foundation.

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,050
So, this is, of course, a prerequisite
or strong influence for this part.

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,270
But also, a lot of the things that we have
done in the Haskell part actually will play

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,580
out here as well.

00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,630
So, that starts with the general idea of
considering a completely new programming paradigm.

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,320
So, that things are really different than
in imperative languages that you have known

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,340
before mostly.

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,110
So, the idea of declarativeness is something
that is common to both Haskell and Prolog

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,980
or both function and logic programming.

00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,330
But also, more specific individual
techniques will be shown by me again.

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:02,730
So, that involves, for example, the fact that we
will do something similar to pattern-matching.

00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,490
So, pattern-matching from the Haskell
side will have its counterpart here.

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,180
Also, the way in which
non-basic types are structured.

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,620
So, the recursive data structures that we
have seen in Haskell will have an analogue

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,790
also in the Prolog part.

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,070
Of course, the syntax will be different, but
the ideas of those recursive data structures

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,290
will reappear.

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,819
And also, some aspects of separation semantics of
the stepwise evaluation or stepwise development

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:40,640
of execution of queries in the case of Prolog
will be at least reminiscent of things that

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,810
we have seen in Haskell.

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,810
Okay.

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,790
Nevertheless, there will also
be important differences.

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,080
So, for one thing, Prolog is neither
command nor expression based.

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,540
So, then in the Haskell part I always made this
distinction between command-based languages

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,550
which I subsume things like Python or Java.

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,500
And expression-based programming, which
is what I focused on in the Haskell part.

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,270
But Prolog is certainly not command-based,
but it's also not expression-based in the

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,959
sense that Prolog execution is not based on
having an expression that is evaluated to

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,680
a value.

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,350
Instead, Prolog is based on propositions.

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,520
So, we have atomic propositions and
logical connectives between those.

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,849
And I already mentioned queries or evaluation
or operational execution of Prolog programs

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,410
will be driven by queries.

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,740
And the point of a query is to see
whether some logical statement is true.

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,720
And not to evaluate something to
a value, to a number, for example.

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,160
So, the main drive will be to have a query
which is a logical expression and the job

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,270
of the Prolog execution system will be to
find out whether that query is true or not.

00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:54,319
So, it's a question of satisfiability mainly and
results will be side products in the sense that

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,629
if you have a query that involves variables, maybe
several ones, then part of the satisfiability

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,690
check will be to assign concrete
instantiations to these variables.

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,440
And then this could be seen
as the output of the program.

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,870
Completely different from the Haskell part
that the outcome is the value to which an

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,100
expression has been reduced in the end.

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,430
So, there are differences; also
pattern-matching will be similar but different.

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,840
So, there will be another aspect
to Prolog style pattern-matching.

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,810
But some ideas will be transferable, and I
just mentioned the operational semantics has

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:36,510
some similar aspects, but
it's not exactly the same.

2 # slide
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,380
Okay, we will start today with
looking at some Prolog basics.

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,280
Yes, we need some introduction, of course.

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
And this will be very example-driven.

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,680
And actually, a lot of the examples already
today also to some degree in later lectures.

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,350
But certainly today, to a large extent taken
from the book Learn Prolog Now, that's one

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,650
of the books I suggested as literature
for Prolog in the very first lecture.

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,190
So, this was a book that is available online.

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,130
So, you don't have to buy it, you
can simply browse it via the web.

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,020
And you will see that a lot of examples that
I've used today can also be found in that

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
book.

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,840
I have changed some of them to make
some points that I want to make.

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,190
So, it's not exactly the same
small programs, but very similar.

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:30,750
That also explains that you will see in a
moment, if you have some pop culture remembrance,

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,490
and you will see that a lot of the examples
in the book and then taken here refer

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,100
to a popular movie that maybe you
will recognize, or maybe you will not.

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Okay.

3 # slide
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,840
So, Prolog in the simplest case.

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:58,669
There I just mentioned queries already, and
on a very first view, Prolog programs can be

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,900
seen as kind of databases
that contain some facts.

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,479
And then you can ask questions about this.

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,400
Actually, this is often also called Datalog,
which is a subset of Prolog where you just

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,419
have these kinds of atomic
facts that you see here.

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,430
So, I will use this to
start explaining the syntax.

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,870
So, what we see here is a
statement like Mia is a woman.

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,870
Jody is a woman.

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,140
So, that's the way it is expressed here.

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,040
So, this is a predicate, some
property that some entity can have.

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,660
And the things that occur in brackets here
are the things about which we say something.

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,790
So, in this case, this is an individual person,
but of course, it's just simpler ultimately.

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,400
So, what we're saying is Mia is a woman,
Jody is a woman, Yolanda is a woman.

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,680
And it appears that Jody plays the air guitar.

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,750
Okay, so this would be a program that you
could put into a file and then load into a

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,810
Prolog engine.

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,240
And then the interaction with
the program would be via queries.

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,640
So, just as in the Haskell interpreter, you
load a program, and then you type in some

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,610
expressions and expect that they evaluate
to something that is then output.

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,590
Here, you would load your fact base into the
engine, and then this is a prompt, and then

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,490
you ask some questions.

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,539
And questions are things that are
statements that can be true or false.

00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,320
You won't get 15 out, but
you'll get true or false out.

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,750
So, if you load this program, these facts
then we can ask things like, is Mia a woman?

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,610
And then Prolog will truthfully
answer yes, or true, right?

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,320
Because that's something that
was contained in the database.

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,290
Okay, an important syntactical aspect here
when you start trying this in the interpreter.

00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,440
So, this dot here is really essential.

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,150
Both here it's really part of the syntax.

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,460
Well, here it's basically the point where we
say that this statement is complete, right?

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,000
And these facts, and also if you pose a query,
then you really have to enter this dot here.

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,300
This can be confusing sometimes in the beginning.

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,780
Because if you just hit enter after the statement
here without the dot, then it will not happen

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,130
what you would expect to happen.

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,039
I mean that the engine starts
answering this question.

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,940
Okay, that is really
something that you should do.

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,190
Okay, then let's ask some other questions.

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,220
So, of course, we can also
ask: Does Jody play air guitar?

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,820
And the answer will also be true.

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,520
Well, simply because it's set in the facts.

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,330
Okay, then we can also ask
questions that turn out to be false.

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,870
So, for example, here we ask whether Mia is
playing the guitar, and the answer is false.

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,300
And that's already the first, well, important
insight maybe, or thing that you should

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
be aware of.

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,180
Namely, of course, we didn't ever say
that Mia does not play the guitar, right?

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,320
We said that Jody plays the air guitar.

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,680
The facts here neither say that Mia does play
the air guitar, nor do they say the opposite.

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,220
And nevertheless, Prolog, if you ask it whether
Mia plays the air guitar, will answer false.

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,130
So, it's claiming that Mia does not play the
guitar, even though that's not expressed here.

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,130
What does this mean?

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,339
Well, it means that Prolog considers everything
false, which is not explicitly proven.

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,080
So, here we state some facts.

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,930
And the idea or interpretation is that these
facts are true, and everything else is false.

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,180
So, if you ask for something, which is not
expressed or not contained and not derivable

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,490
from the facts, then Prolog will not only
say, I don't know because I can't prove that

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,490
Mia plays the air guitar.

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,520
Prolog will actually say false.

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,700
That's also called negation of failure in
the sense that Prolog considers this to be

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,510
not true, because it can't prove it.

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,830
Okay, that's not necessarily the way
that you understand mathematical logic.

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,660
Where you say that if I had not proven that,
or I don't know that Mia plays the air guitar,

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,950
because it's not said here.

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,160
That doesn't necessarily mean that I know
that Mia does not play the air guitar.

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,750
But actually, Prolog has that interpretation.

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,770
Okay, if we have a question which is not answered
positively by the knowledge base that we have,

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:04,930
then actually the statement is
considered to be not true, not the case.

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,500
Okay.

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,180
That even extends to situations like this where
we ask something about a person or individual

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,690
or entity that isn't part of the program.

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,690
Right?

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,420
Well, for Mia, we knew it's a woman.

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,100
We didn't know anything
about her playing air guitar.

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,390
So, Prolog said, well, she
doesn't play the air guitar.

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,260
Now, if you ask whether Vincent is playing
air guitar, Prolog will also say false.

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,270
It will also say no.

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,440
Vincent's not playing air guitar, even though
we haven't said anything about Vincent.

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes.

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,700
So, from the Prolog program that you've seen
up here, Vincent isn't even a thing, a person,

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,120
he is not even present as an entity.

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,910
But nevertheless, we can ask whether Vincent
plays air guitar and Prolog will say no.

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,150
I have never heard about Vincent.

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,190
I've never heard something
about him playing air guitar.

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,200
So, it's not true.

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,250
It's actually false that
he's playing the air guitar.

00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,450
Okay.

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,130
And then some final examples, basic example, we
could also ask whether Jody plays the piano.

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,980
We don't know anything about that, right?

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,060
We only know that Jody plays air guitar.

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,930
We don't know that Jody plays piano.

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,410
So, the answer could be false.

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,740
But actually, it's a bit more subtle in this
case, because sometimes Prolog or some Prolog

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:24,230
systems, or Prolog systems of certain settings,
will actually, in this case, even give an error

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,830
message, right?

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,600
Whereas entities that are not known or simply
assumed to exist, but not satisfying any of

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
the properties.

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
That's where we get false here.

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,170
If you actually ask a
question that's not defined.

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,010
So, there's nothing known
about anybody playing piano.

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,790
So, if you ask something like "Does Jody
play piano?", some Prolog systems will

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,519
actually assume that we made a typo and
maybe have written a wrong predicate here.

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,720
So, there's some useful interpretation
saying, well, it's false.

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,420
But actually, some systems will rather complain
and say, probably you meant a different property

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
here.

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:09,110
Okay, this will not occur of course, if you only
use predicates, property names that actually

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,490
occurred in the fact base, or that have been
defined by you in the tasks when you start

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,740
solving exercise tasks.

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,800
Okay, then you shouldn't get this error message.

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,060
Unless you have really made a typo and written
some predicate that doesn't make sense or

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,089
wasn't to be used.

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,580
Okay, that's very simple.

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,029
Let's make it slightly more interesting.

4 # slide
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:40,519
Okay, so what we have here is not any more
just facts, but also some implications or

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,519
rules, right?

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,050
So, the first two lines are things
of a style, you have already seen.

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,240
Then saying something like,
well, Yolanda is happy.

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,330
And Mia listens to music, okay.

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,480
And then there's something new here in this
line, and then the other two lines are similar.

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,680
Namely, we have this strange symbol here.

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,060
And then we have to the left and to the
right, we have some statement, right?

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,320
To the left, we have Yolanda listens to music,
and to the right, we have Yolanda is happy.

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,640
If you take this again as
a property of this entity.

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,860
Okay, so what is the meaning of the symbol
here?

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,110
And likewise, of course, in the
other two lines, that it's an if.

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,209
So, this is the rule that we have here.

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,339
The left-hand side is called the head and
the right-hand side is called the body.

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,250
Yes, many rule-based settings.

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,710
So, the idea is that is the head,
which is implied by the body.

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,579
So, how is this to be read?

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,560
It's if Yolanda is happy,
then she listens to music.

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,240
That's an adaptation of this rule.

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,240
And likewise, if Mia listens to
music, then Mia plays air guitar.

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,620
If Yolanda listens to music,
then Yolanda plays air guitar.

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,209
Okay, so these two are facts and these three
rules, and they can be used to make logical

00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,209
deductions.

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:01,180
So, now we can ask questions that are not
explicitly answerable just by looking at facts,

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,050
but where actually Prolog needs to
combine the facts that are known.

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,910
Plus, some statements, implications, some rules.

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,050
Okay, in this look where, for example,
you can ask whether Mia plays air guitar.

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,060
And while there is no fact stating that
actually Prolog will nevertheless say true.

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,230
And how is that?

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,350
Well, because Prolog knows that Mia
listens to music, that was a fact.

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,380
And then there's the rule that if Mia
listens to music, then Mia plays air guitar.

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,680
So, Prolog will deduce this from what
we know about the facts and the rules.

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,760
That indeed, yes, Mia plays air guitar.

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay, what about Yolanda?

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,920
We can also ask whether Yolanda plays air
guitar.

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,470
And if you work this out here, then you will
find that Prolog is right in answering true.

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,459
So, actually, it's now a two-step reasoning.

00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,530
Namely, it's not as simple as for Mia,
where we have, if she listens to music then

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,750
she plays air guitar.

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,079
For Yolanda, we actually would have to know
that she listens to music in order to establish

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,250
that she plays air guitar.

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,640
But actually that Yolanda listens
to music is not itself a fact.

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,130
It's also something that only follows from
rule.

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:20,149
Namely, we know that Yolanda listens to music
if she is happy, and we also know that she

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,149
is happy.

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,380
So, actually, Prolog will use the knowledge
to the maximum extent and really work out

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,459
in this case that Yolanda
indeed plays the air guitar.

00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,300
Using this reasoning well since Yolanda is
happy based on this fact, she listens to music

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,110
based on this rule, right?

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,790
Of course, now this is forward reasoning.

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,740
Whereas here, the rules are written backwards.

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,720
This is the case if that is the case.

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,209
So, that Yolanda implies listens to music
Yolanda, and by the last rule this in turn

00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,199
implies that Yolanda plays the air guitar.

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,639
So, the answer here is true.

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,540
And of course, we don't see this reasoning
here.

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,980
At least not in this mode here, there are
some debug features where you could find out

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,899
how Prolog arrived at this conclusion.

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,519
But actually, this is not visible
and interpreter just as in Haskell.

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,990
If you enter an expression, you get the result.

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,050
You don't get the stepwise evaluation of
that result, not by default at least.

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:20,070
Okay, so here, we ask a question, and Prolog
gives an answer based on some reasoning and a

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,600
test run in the background.

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Okay.

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,440
So, there is new syntax.

5 # slide
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,270
Let's look at even more complex rules, right?

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,029
These are very simple rules.

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:38,150
Some facts and then if this then that, so
one statement implies another statement.

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,850
From logic, you know that of course, you can
have more complicated implications where maybe

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,140
you have to combine several
statements to derive another one.

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,380
So, that would be something
like this in Prolog as well.

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,440
Otherwise, it could only write
very simple programs and rules.

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,730
Let's look at some more complex rules.

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,449
And there are basically two things
that are relevant on this slide.

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,439
The first thing is that we can have on the
right-hand side several statements, right?

00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,089
Here are, again, two very simple facts.

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,199
Vincent is happy and Butch listens to music.

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,120
And then we have this rule, which is saying
Vincent plays the air guitar if, well, what

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
if?

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,589
Well, if two things are true apparently, right?

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,890
So, indeed, this comma here is
simply the interpretation of and.

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,659
So, you can add a list of things here.

00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:32,559
And then the logical interpretation is,
well, all of these things have to be true

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,720
in order to apply these rules.

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Basically, it's the same.

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,929
Vincent plays the air guitar if this
is the case and this is the case.

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,080
So, the comma is the and.

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,740
There we don't write and,
we simply use the comma.

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,980
Okay, then we can ask whether
Vincent plays air guitar.

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,580
And whether this will be the case, let's look.

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,600
Well, the only way to establish this would
be by this rule, and then it would have to

00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,999
be the case that Vincent listens to music.

00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,389
And Vincent is happy.

00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,929
One of these is true.

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:03,929
Vincent is indeed happy.

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,919
But we don't know anything about
Vincent listening to music.

00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,460
Because the only fact is about
Butch, not about Vincent.

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,999
There are also no rules that would establish
that means he might listen to music.

00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,639
So, we don't know that this is true.

00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:22,330
And Prolog assumes it is false, where the
reasoning or the interpretation mentioned

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,360
before.

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,870
And then it's not the case that
both of these things are true.

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,360
So, we can't deduce that Vincent plays air
guitar, and if Prolog can't deduce that Vincent

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,519
plays air guitar, then Prolog
assumes that he doesn't.

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,200
Okay, the answer is here false.

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,230
Because we can't apply this rule.

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,860
Because we don't know all the preconditions.

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,380
Okay, what about Butch?

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,999
Well, there are two rules about Butch.

00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,929
How should this be interpreted?

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:55,710
Maybe also, we can't establish that Butch plays
the air guitar because we don't know anything

00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,909
about him being happy.

00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:57,909
Right.

00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,429
We know this about Vincent, but not about Butch.

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:07,249
But there's another rule which claims that if
Butch listens to music, then he plays the air

00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:08,249
guitar.

00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:11,479
And we actually do know
that Butch listens to music.

00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:16,649
Okay, so actually, this will be
evaluated or derived as true.

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,320
So, this is a statement that is true.

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Why?

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,950
Because we have these two rules, and
Prolog can choose to use either of them.

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,820
And if Prolog chooses to use this,
or actually it will try both.

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,580
And for the first one, it won't have success
because there's no knowledge about Butch being

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
happy.

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,999
But since there was the second rule, and here
we can see that the precondition is true because

00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:41,049
of this fact, Prolog will actually deduce and
it's right to say, well, indeed, Butch does

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,429
play air guitar.

00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:47,519
So, if you have something like these two rules which
have the same head, then that's an alternative.

00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,690
It's like an or.

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,690
Right?

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,250
The comma here means and.

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,649
These two things have to be
true for this to be true.

00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,809
Here we have, if this is true, then this is
true.

00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:58,999
If this is true, or this is true, which is
the same as saying that if either of these

00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,340
is true, then we have this, right?

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,429
So, we don't have to establish
both, we can establish one.

00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:07,880
And then deduce what we want.

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,539
That's how this worked out here.

00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,470
Indeed, there is an alternative notation.

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,809
Where this is made more explicit.

00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:20,309
So, we could combine these two
rules into one with the common head.

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,600
And in the body, we would combine
these two bodies with a semicolon.

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,289
So, whereas the comma is used as the and.

00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:29,220
And we could use the semicolon
as an or on the right-hand side.

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,519
But this is equivalent to having these two rules
or having this rule, but actually in practice,

00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:43,029
and also in the examples in this course, from
my side at least, I will use the comma for

00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,869
the and, for putting several things
on the right-hand side of one rule.

00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,299
But I won't usually use the semicolon.

00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:53,350
So, if I have something like this, I would
rather write two rules which are independent,

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,289
and each of them establishes something
under one of the preconditions.

00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,490
And I wouldn't put them into
one rule with the semicolon.

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,970
Partly because it's easy to confuse the
comma and the semicolon for beginners, right?

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,960
So, if you see these two rules, one is with a
comma, and one is with a semicolon, you might

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,429
not immediately spot the very important logical
difference as these two rules make clear

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:22,989
that either one of these statements can be
used to establish the head here, the common

00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:23,989
head.

00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:24,989
Okay, it's probably better to write it like
this.

00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:31,440
But I will write it like this in
I think all or almost all cases.

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:43,649
Okay, that was more complex rules now involving
logical connectives or equivalent descriptions

00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,979
to a logical or in this case.

00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:51,990
Okay, what else can we make more
interesting about the examples?

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,039
Well, these statements are all boring in some
sense, as they are always saying something

00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,879
only about one individual, right?

00:21:58,879 --> 00:21:59,879
Vincent is happy.

00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:00,950
Butch is listening to music, et cetera.

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,999
If we have complex rules, which combine several
statements, but they're always about one person

00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,019
or one individual.

00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:10,159
We don't have statements that relate to that.

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,950
So far, we don't have statements
that relate to several entities.

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,950
Okay.

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,440
That’s something we should certainly change.

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,389
And indeed, the way to do this is
to consider basically relations.

00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:26,039
So, logical programming is sometimes also called
relational programming because, basically,

00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:34,999
in the general case, we talk about relations between
entities, just as in predicate logic, you assign

00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:38,769
two predicates like this.

00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,649
Some relation has its semantic interpretation.

00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:42,809
How is this syntactically treated?

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,649
Well, we would have statements
that relate more than one person.

00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:51,899
So, basically, in the brackets here,
we can list more than one individual.

6 # slide
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:54,639
Okay, that's happened in this program.

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,720
For example, what do we have here?

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,019
We have some basic facts about
one individual each, right?

00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,830
Mia is a woman, Jody, and Yolanda is a woman.

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,359
Those are facts, which we
have seen before already.

00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,119
But then we can also have predicate
statements that relate two individuals.

00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,580
So, here the interpretation
is: Vincent loves Mia.

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,059
Marsellus loves Mia.

00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,059
Mia loves Vincent.

00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,119
And Vincent is self-loving.

00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,830
Okay, that way now you know
which movie this is about.

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,690
Okay.

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:39,200
So, in the position here of something like
this is relation or multi-ary in this case,

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,340
binary predicate.

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,109
As these are unary predicates, basically set
interpretation saying something, which are

00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:48,840
the women, these three.

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:55,230
Here we have a relation in the binary
predicate relating always two entities.

00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,080
Okay, what kind of queries
can be asked about this?

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,470
Well, of course, you could ask
questions like does Marsellus love Mia?

00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,649
And the answer would be true.

00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,999
We could ask does Marsellus,
or does Mia love Marsellus?

00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,429
And the answer would be wrong.

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,320
Because there is no statement here.

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,379
So, the interpretation would again be if some
relation is not expressed in the program,

00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:19,580
then it is not the case.

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,739
Okay, now the heading here is more complex
query.

00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:29,549
So, we actually want to go beyond just again,
asking basic questions directly from these

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:30,549
facts.

00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:33,049
So, let's use a query like this.

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:36,869
So, we can ask queries where we have variables.

00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:42,390
And here you already see the maybe
unfortunate difference to Haskell.

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,009
It's not unfortunate in general, but of course,
in this course, it's a bit sometimes confusing

00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:54,969
that the roles of lower and upper-case identifiers
are basically switched between Haskell and

00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:55,969
Prolog, right?

00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,419
So, in Haskell, variables
would always be lowercase.

00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:04,749
Whereas in Prolog, the convention is
that upper case things are variables.

00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:07,210
Okay, so what is this saying?

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,769
It's a query where we don't ask, "Is Mia
a woman or is Jody or is Vincent a woman?"

00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:19,289
But we ask, "Is X a woman?" The question
basically means, "Is there an X that is a woman?"

00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,330
What should Prolog answer in this case?

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,690
Well, you could say it should answer yes.

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,269
Because we have entities that are women.

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:30,940
But then we wouldn't learn as
much as actually what are the X.

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Right?

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,979
So, what Prolog is doing in a query like this
with variables, not only saying true and false

00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,369
as in all the previous examples
that didn't have variables.

00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,669
If you had a query with variables,
then Prolog might also say false.

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,840
If simply, there's no way to
establish the statement here.

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,259
But if there is, then it won't simply say "true",
it will actually tell us for which X it is

00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,259
true.

00:25:54,259 --> 00:26:00,059
So, if we issue this query to Prolog,
it will say something like X is Mia.

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,179
So, it's not just saying true.

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,489
It's actually saying X is Mia, and the
meaning of this is: yes, it's true.

00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,580
For the case that X is Mia.

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,269
Again, you already see the semicolon here,
it's actually not something that Prolog would

00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:13,269
output.

00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,799
So, Prolog would output this like this: X is
Mia.

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,070
And then it would be the user's
task to either accept this.

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,080
And enter a dot and say, okay, that's fine.

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,440
So, you would use the dot now to actually say
fine, or you could answer with a semicolon.

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,860
And remember, the semicolon corresponds in
Prolog interpretation of logic to an "or".

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,969
So, basically, what it is meaning is, if the
user enters this, then you would be asking

00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:45,100
Prolog that Prolog has told you
that X equals Mia is a woman.

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,649
Then you could say "or" in the sense
of: or, is there maybe also another X?

00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,649
Yes.

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,559
So, if you enter the semicolon, then Prolog
would say, well, maybe you don't like my solution

00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,559
that X is Mia.

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,559
You ask or.

00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,999
Well, then I tell you another choice.

00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:03,659
So, Prolog would say, well, Jody is also a
woman, because that's also something that

00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,210
follows from the fact base.

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:13,219
Okay, and then you could again enter a semicolon,
and then Prolog would answer with the final

00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:16,120
option, namely the X could also be Yolanda.

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,469
Again, Prolog will actually have worked out
that these are exactly three choices that

00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:21,669
make this statement true.

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:23,929
So, there are no further options.

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,039
Okay, why?

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,440
Again, because if something is not set or
derivable from the knowledge, then it's not

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
true.

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,129
So, if you ask what are the women, then Prolog
will offer exactly these three and no further

00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:37,129
ones.

00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:42,489
Because there is no additional information
that anybody else would fit this predicate.

00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:44,999
Okay, so that's nice.

00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:48,789
You can ask questions like that, that
don't yet involve these binary predicates.

00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:53,979
But we can, of course, now with variables also
ask questions that involve this predicate.

00:27:53,979 --> 00:28:00,789
For example, we can ask mixed questions where
some positions of the predicates are indeed

00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,259
concrete entities and others are variables.

00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:10,840
So, for example, we can ask whether it
is true that Vincent loves somebody?

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,399
Okay.

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,099
And then what would be the answers?

00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,809
Well, the answer could be true.

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,919
Because indeed, it is the case that Vincent
loves somebody, but actually, again, Prolog

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,339
didn't simply say true.

00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,679
It would tell us whom Vincent loves.

00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,989
So, the answer would be, well, Mia, certainly.

00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:32,169
And again, if you asked for, well, what else?

00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:39,729
Then Prolog would also answer that, indeed,
also, X equals Vincent is a reasonable answer.

00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:46,070
Okay, and then you could even go further and
ask, well maybe you want to know more, or you

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,719
want to combine these two queries.

00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:53,299
Maybe you want to ask, well, is there somebody
who is a woman and who is loved by Vincent?

00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,299
Yes.

00:28:54,299 --> 00:29:00,440
Also, of course, then excluding
this last, or this answer here.

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,489
And that can be done by also in
the query using our connectives.

00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:10,369
So, I previously in the previous slide, used
a comma in the right-hand side of the rule,

00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:12,070
to express that something has to be true.

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,350
And something else also has to be true.

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,080
And I can also do this in a query.

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,879
So, a query need not be just one
predicate with some arguments.

00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:20,360
A query could also look like this.

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,929
So, the comma is again an "and".

00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,750
So, I'm asking here, these two questions at
once.

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,559
And, of course, at once also in the sense
that I want to use the same X here.

00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,100
So, I don't get all combinations
of what was possible here.

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:42,690
So, I'm getting combinations where Vincent
loves an X and that specific X is a woman.

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,239
And then, of course, you can see this already
well, either from the program or from the

00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,239
solutions here.

00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:51,580
The answer should now be only Mia.

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,239
What might happen here is not necessarily
the case in all Prolog implementations.

00:29:56,239 --> 00:30:00,690
But, well, of course, we know
that Mia is the only answer here.

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,929
So, Prolog could also have put
a dot here and be done with it.

00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:11,379
But actually, due to the internal way of how
this logic solving is organized, it will often

00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:15,109
be the case that Prolog actually at this
point still offers possible alternatives.

00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:19,039
So, the user would say: Well, "or",
is there maybe another solution?

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,980
And only then Prolog will say false.

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,029
Where it's equivalent to
saying X is Mia or false.

00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:27,549
And where something or false
is just that something.

00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:32,219
So, it is equivalent to saying that
X equals Mia is the only solution.

00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:40,690
Okay, which makes perfect sense because that's
exactly what follows from what we had here.

00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,960
Okay, that's already a nice, interesting example.

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,750
Okay, what else could we hope for
in terms of a programming language?

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:56,259
Well, maybe we don't want to use variables
just in queries, but also in the program.

00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,259
Right?

00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:03,129
It's ultimately boring in the program, the
fact bases always have just ground statements

00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,129
with fixed individuals, right?

00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,889
So, that's what we had so far.

00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:10,849
We did have unary predicates, binary predicates,
we did have rules, we have something appeared

00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,129
on the right-hand side, but
it was always very concrete.

00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:15,409
We always mentioned certain specifics.

00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:23,340
Well, in this case, persons, otherwise,
simply entities, atoms in our statements.

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,499
And now we used variables in querying.

00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:32,129
Of course, you also want to use variables
in rules, and that's certainly possible.

00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:37,750
And an example of this would be as follows.

7 # slide
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,320
Okay, what do we have here?

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,950
Well, now the statements
become even more interesting.

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:49,860
So, we have, again, some basic facts about
this binary relation about love relationships.

00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,080
So, Vincent loves Mia.

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Marsellus loves Mia.

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,999
And Mia loves Vincent.

00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,979
Okay, good for him.

00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:00,729
Maybe depending on characteristics
of Mia, of course.

00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,209
She's a bit crazy.

00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:05,780
If you know the movie.

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,149
Well, and then there is some
statement about variables.

00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:14,249
So, we define basically a new relation.

00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:21,379
But it's not defined by listing explicitly
some pairs that fulfill this relationship.

00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:23,470
But actually, it's a derived property.

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,559
It's a rule involving
generalized cases with variables.

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,599
What this is saying is, well, X is jealous
of Y.

00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,940
If X loves Z and Y loves Z.

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:45,529
So, in some sense, if X and Y love the
same third entity, then X is jealous of Y.

00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:49,889
That's a reasonable concept of jealousy, I
guess.

00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:53,349
Okay, so now, how could some querying work?

00:32:53,349 --> 00:33:00,879
Well, for example, one could ask whether
Marsellus is jealous of somebody.

00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,169
And if you have this concept in mind, then
you would expect that probably Marsellus

00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,330
is jealous of somebody.

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,959
Namely, probably Marsellus is jealous of Vincent.

00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,470
Because they both love Mia.

00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,799
Okay, so it's reasonable to get this answer.

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,589
And then we could ask again whether
maybe there's some other solution.

00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:18,789
So, maybe we get false here.

00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,450
Well, let's see what will actually happen.

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:27,490
If we asked whether Marsellus is
jealous of somebody else as well.

00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,960
Well, indeed he is.

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,119
Then he is also jealous of himself.

00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,190
Okay, that's maybe surprising.

00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,840
But not if we take this logical
reading here into account.

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,139
Because what it is saying is well, X is
jealous of Y if they both love the same person.

00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:50,919
And actually, even though there are two variables
here, they could both be the same entity.

00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:51,999
Right?

00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:55,059
So, that's the same as in most programming
languages, also in Haskell, of course.

00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,690
If we have two variables, then they
need not have the same instantiation.

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,470
But there we might have: well, if you have an
equation, "function f x y is something" and

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,570
of course, nobody prevents f from
being called with five and five.

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,849
And similarly, here, this concept also can be
used for situations where X and Y are actually

00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:16,849
the same.

00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:22,730
So, if we use Marsellus and Marsellus here,
then since Marsellus loves Mia, then Marsellus

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,190
is jealous of Marsellus, and hence,
this is a valid solution here.

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,579
There are no further solutions here.

00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:30,389
If we ask for further solutions,
the answer would be "false".

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:36,519
Okay, so there is use of interpretation, given
that different variables might still refer

00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,089
to the same entity.

00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:41,440
Well, of course, also is detailed here.

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,149
But good to know that of course, this
X here has nothing to do with this X.

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,149
Right?

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:50,799
So, we don't have to be careful about using
different variable names in the queries than

00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,940
in the program.

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,809
That's just a renaming.

00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:54,809
Yes.

00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:55,929
So, there are different scopes.

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:00,190
So, here we asked for the X in the answer.

00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:05,460
And there's no possible confusion between
this X and that X because, for example, this

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:12,510
could be renamed to X1 and Y1, and then it's
clear that this is the first, and this is the

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,510
second argument.

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,170
So, there is no interaction
with this X and that X here.

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,930
Yeah, so this is valid, exactly as written
here.

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,300
Okay, so that's something we can
ask whom Marsellus is jealous of.

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,920
And maybe surprisingly, he is
jealous of himself as well.

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,570
But that's actually not that surprising.

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,859
If you read this logically, then there
are some other things we could ask.

00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,029
So, for example, we can ask something like
this.

00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:39,190
What's the meaning of that?

00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:45,390
Well, it's also asking whether X is jealous of
... and then there's this strange underscore,

00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,319
but it's not so strange, actually.

00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,770
It's just an anonymous variable.

00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,349
Yeah, that's actually the same
syntax as in Haskell, right?

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,500
The underscore for "something we don't care".

00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
We don't know.

00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
We don't care.

00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,109
What this is saying is whether jealous
X something, someone in this case.

00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,180
And we are not interested
in who that other person is.

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,460
So, we will get solutions for X.

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,720
Of course, each solution for X and this predicate
must also come with a partner of whom X is

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
jealous.

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
But this will not be printed, right?

00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,779
So, this is something like a variable that we
don't care about the result, about instantiation.

00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:23,200
So, hence, what would happen
if we issue this statement?

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,130
Well, we already know that
Marsellus is jealous of somebody.

00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,740
We also know, for the same reason,
that Vincent is jealous of somebody.

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,660
Because we could as well have asked
this question with Vincent here.

00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,490
Okay, so certainly, Vincent
is jealous of somebody.

00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,269
So, indeed, if we ask this question, then
we'll get an answer for X, namely, Vincent.

00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,882
And there's no answer for this
underscore, because this is anonymous.

00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:47,900
We don't care about that.

00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,380
Okay, what else?

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,030
Well, Vincent again.

00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,980
So, we ask this question and Prolog
will say, well, X is Vincent.

00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,480
And by the way, X is Vincent is another solution.

00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,829
Why is that?

00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:06,849
Well, basically, Prolog will explore all possibilities
how X could be jealous of somebody else.

00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:13,130
And well, since, by the same reasoning as above
here, Vincent is both jealous of Marsellus

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,789
but also jealous of himself.

00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:18,340
There's actually two ways in
which Vincent can be jealous.

00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,560
So, actually, we get two solutions.

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,109
What this means is that basically the results
that Prolog gives here are multi sets, not

00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,109
just sets.

00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:29,279
So, Prolog will not give every answer only
once.

00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:33,920
Prolog will give every answer as many
times as it was established to be true.

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,680
And likewise, there are two ways in
which Marsellus is jealous of somebody.

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,010
We have actually seen this above here.

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,250
So, again, Prolog will twice answer
that Marsellus is jealous of somebody.

00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:52,880
And we ignore of whom he is jealous,
but nevertheless, you get two solutions.

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,130
Okay, and if we then ask for further
solutions, and actually, Mia is also jealous.

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,150
Of whom is Mia jealous?

00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,289
Well, only of herself.

00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:06,589
Yes, so Mia loves Vincent.

00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:09,579
But that also means that Mia is jealous of
Mia.

00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,830
Because both Mia and Mia love Vincent.

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:20,160
Okay, maybe these are strange results or prime
results, but they follow from what we have

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,040
written here.

00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,309
Okay, how could we repair this, maybe?

00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,730
Well, let's say we don't want this.

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,579
We really only want a person to be
jealous if there is some competitor.

00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:37,220
Yes, we maybe don't want that Mia is seen to
be jealous just because she loves Vincent.

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,210
So, she shouldn't be jealous of herself.

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:45,310
Well, I already mentioned that different variables
can be the same person here, the same entity.

00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,780
So, if you don't want this, you
have to explicitly forbid this.

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,130
Can we do this?

00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,319
Yes, we can say something like, and
the syntax will be shown in a moment,

00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:00,619
we can say X is jealous of Y if
they both love the same person.

00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:03,539
And actually, they are two different entities.

00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:09,089
So, we could say something like if X is
different from Y and X loves Z, and Y loves Z,

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,400
then X is jealous of Y.

8 # slide
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,170
Okay, here is how this has to be written.

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,170
Yes.

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,119
So, this is slightly different
than Haskell syntax for not equal.

00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,119
Yes.

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,260
In Haskell, the slash would
be differently oriented.

00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,500
So, here this backslash is
the negation of equality.

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,029
Okay, so the base facts are the same.

00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:37,680
The rule is almost the same but now we
explicitly say: X is different from Y.

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,960
Okay, does it have the desired effect?

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Let's check.

00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,599
Well, let me come back to this in a moment.

00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,930
So, the reason that I put this here and
not at the beginning, but does it work?

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,970
Well, it does work in the sense that if I now
ask whether Marsellus is jealous of someone,

00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,940
then the answer is yes.

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,990
And it is exactly one instantiation.

00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,680
Namely, Marsellus is jealous of Vincent.

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,460
There's no answer anymore that Marsellus is
jealous of himself because we have excluded

00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,289
exactly this strange jealousness by
this property, by this statement.

00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:19,280
Okay, and for the other question whether or
who are all the persons who are jealous of

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
somebody?

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,130
Well, we still get Vincent, but only once.

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,009
We also get Marsellus, but only once because
all these self-jealousness situations are

00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:32,269
excluded now by this constraint.

00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:37,020
And importantly, we don't
get that Mia is jealous.

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,940
Because she isn't under the interpretation
that you can only be jealous of somebody else.

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Okay.

00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:50,880
And of course, well, if you are actually interested
in who is jealous of whom and not just whether

00:40:50,880 --> 00:41:00,520
somebody is jealous at all, you could also
avoid or defer this anonymous variable.

00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,190
And use a real variable here.

00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,390
Something like Y and then you
could ask questions like that.

00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,690
And then we would get well,
Vincent is jealous of Marsellus.

00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,069
That explains the first answer here.

00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:12,220
But also Marsellus is jealous of
Vincent, that explains the second answer.

00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,250
And there are no further cases.

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:20,650
So, that's now also a reasonable
connection between these two observations.

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:28,540
Okay, an important thing here is this part,
namely, a negation like this has to be at the

00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,029
end of the rule.

00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,980
I won't go into detail at this point.

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,240
Why that is the case for now,
and also for the exercise tasks.

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,940
Keep in mind that if you want to express something
negatively, then it's always the best idea

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,059
to do this at the end of the rule or query.

00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:51,039
So, if we were to put this at the beginning
here, then the interpretation from Prolog

00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,420
side would be slightly different.

00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,470
Some queries would still work as expected,
and others might give surprising results.

00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,900
Okay.

00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:05,750
So, in general, negation
has to be used carefully.

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:12,859
That also refers to things like, later checking
that something is or is not the empty list.

00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:18,160
Yes, remember, in Haskell, we could use pattern
matching to distinguish between empty, non-empty

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
lists.

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,180
Or we could have a statement like:
if xs is not the empty list.

00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,650
In Haskell, this was equivalent.

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:31,130
In Prolog, there are subtle differences between
expressing something with a pattern-match,

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,750
as you will see is possible
just similarly to in Haskell.

00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,460
It's also possible to use negation.

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,790
But negation is always a bit special in Prolog.

00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,950
So, if you can express something
without negation, that's better.

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:53,509
If you have to express something with negation,
like in this case, at least try to use negation

00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:59,609
as late as possible in this case, by putting
it at the end of this statement here.

00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:03,259
For a moment that's the only thing you
have to remember really for the exercise.

00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:07,720
If you have something negative like this not
equal, put it at the end of your query or

00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,279
at the end of your rule.
