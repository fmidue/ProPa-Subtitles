00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,759
In this video, I want to talk about what is
sometimes called wholemeal programming, in

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,780
this case on lists.

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,379
I already briefly mentioned this concept of
wholemeal programming, as opposed to piecemeal

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,220
programming when we talked about
animations as time-dependent functions.

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:28,810
I mentioned that in CodeWorld, if we define an
animation as a function, then in some sense,

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,340
we program the whole animation at once.

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,050
So, you don't write a command sequence: first
do this, and then the picture moves there,

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,050
and then this happens.

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,899
Of course, you use case distinction to distinguish
different cases, but there is one function

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,850
as a whole which describes the whole animation for
all time points, instead of having a sequencing.

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,910
The same idea of wholemeal programming
can also be applied to lists.

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,640
And it is sometimes used in
literature as well in books.

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,820
If you tried to translate this to German,
there's no one-to-one translation, I think,

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,130
so piecemeal programming (the opposite of
wholemeal programming) could maybe be translated

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,350
as "stückweise" / "allmählich", somewhat
"unsystematisch", whereas for wholemeal programming,

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,320
the German translation would
maybe be "in einem Rutsch".

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,840
So, to do something at once / in one go, rather
than in many different small steps by looking

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,369
at individual list elements by indexing, etc.

81 # slide
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:35,690
In the context of functional programming, the
concept of wholemeal programming is nicely

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,960
summarized by these two quotes here.

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,810
So, this time, no quote by a medieval
king, but by two former Oxford professors.

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,689
Ralf is now at the University of
Kaiserslautern after a few years in Oxford.

00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,539
And Richard is actually retired by
now. (He sadly passed away in 2022.)

00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,000
And they both talk here about
the same idea: thinking big.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,660
Thinking about a whole solution at once, a
whole solution space, instead of maybe an

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,660
individual solution.

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,080
So, the quote by Ralf actually goes on to
talk about, in a setting of graph algorithms,

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,390
to think about a graph as a whole,
rather than about individual paths.

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:17,819
So, it is all the same idea: to think about
data structures as a whole thing rather than

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,390
talking about individual elements, for example.

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,590
Richard here also talks about indexitis.

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,620
That's also something that I mentioned before
when I talked about the index access on lists

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,319
being a no-go in Haskell; that it exists,
but you should always try to avoid it, and

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,010
write programs by different
approaches and different ideas.

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,210
So, that is the same sentiment that Richard
expresses here: to say that indexitis is a

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,379
disease which hinders good program design.

00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:54,000
And he talks about lawful program construction,
so: having algebraic laws about your programs

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,349
is encouraged and helped if you think about
comprehensive operations on your data structures

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,569
like lists, instead of piecewise access.

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,680
Also, dealing with infinite lists is, in some
sense, an outcome of wholemeal programming,

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,840
because then you don't want to talk (too much
at least) about individual list elements,

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,390
but maybe about lists as a
whole, and their processing.

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,349
We could also ask for our functions we have
seen so far, whether or not they are good

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,459
examples of wholemeal vs. piecemeal programming.

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,450
So, the Quicksort implementation from
last week is not obviously either one.

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,849
There is some element-wise processing there.

00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,860
List comprehensions are often a good
example of wholemeal programming.

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,070
So, that also occurred in that example.

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,840
If you think about the "isPalindrome" example,
there were two versions in the slides.

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,599
There was this version which simply
compared the list with its reverse.

00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,230
This is a very good example of wholemeal programming
because we don't touch individual elements,

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,240
but simply express a property
of the list as a whole.

00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,069
Then there was this more recursive definition
which was looking at the first and the last

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,299
elements and then did a recursive call.

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,819
That's something that maybe doesn't suffer
from indexitis because we never talk explicitly

00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,500
about indices of data elements in the list.

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,370
But even this recursive process is
not really wholemeal programming.

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,170
It really talks about the first element and
the last element, makes the list smaller,

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,130
etc., instead of the nice reverse-based solution
which simply says: a list is a palindrome

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,050
if it is the same as its reverse.

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,160
You can't really express it in a more
comprehensive overall way in one go.

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,550
That's a very nice example.

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,940
In some sense, the version of "isPalindrome"
that I developed in the video just before

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,630
this one could also be seen as in
the spirit of wholemeal programming.

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,670
Because it also talks about the list as a
whole.

00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,620
It has a list comprehension, then it says
"and", so everything in this list should be

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,620
true.

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,530
That is also something where you express something
in one go rather than programming a recursion

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,790
over the list structure.

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:16,160
These would be nice examples, and you
will see further examples, of course.

82 # slide
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,830
This is another example we
have already seen earlier.

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:26,580
It occurred in the context of
discussing why we do not use for-loops.

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,010
And indeed, we don't *have* for-loops because
we have different ways to express something

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,160
like a repetition, in this case,
of pictures in a certain scene.

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,810
The numbers here are not list indices.

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,540
We have [0..5], but this is not list indexing.

00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,650
It is just a comprehensive way to express
that we have several scenes, and they all

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,840
will be computed by this function down there.

00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:00,770
So, this is, in some sense, the wholemeal
approach, because we expressed the application

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,380
of "scene" to these elements in one go.

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,230
There is no loop counter, no explicit
loop control, or something like that.

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,560
So, it is the same reasons that I mentioned
there, why this is not the same as doing looping

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,630
in an imperative language.

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,610
In the same sense, this is wholemeal
as opposed to a piecemeal approach.

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,260
So, there wasn't any conceptual
consideration of one happening after another.

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,460
That is simply not happening here.

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,190
One could, of course, have performed this
computation somehow recursively, defining

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,850
a recursive function, but why should we do
this?

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,470
Why should we bother with this?

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,600
So, programming a recursion here would have
exposed some kind of traversal order which

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,150
we don't need, if we are simply
interested in "we have these pictures".

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,290
As I already mentioned, in the mathematical
set notation, we simply get: "for all numbers

00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,250
in a certain range, ..." or maybe even "all
the numbers" if we have infinite lists, we

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,030
compute some value, and we
get the result of that.

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,030
That's it.

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:11,970
In one go rather than writing a
loop counter and a looping program.

83 # slide
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,780
Of course, the individual evaluation of these
Pictures (the computation of the different

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,260
scenes) will still happen in some
order on a sequential machine.

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,240
And also, the list is a sequence,
it is not a mathematical set.

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
So, it has some order.

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,940
But the individual values
are independent of order.

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,440
So, it doesn't matter whether I first compute
the third thing and then the zeroth thing,

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
or the other way around.

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,840
The values will be independent of that
because they are independent computations.

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,500
There is no effect that somehow goes and influences
the third computation based on what happened

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
in the first computation.

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,720
That is because these are values
that are computed from expressions.

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,750
Indeed, one can show some properties that
wouldn't hold in an incremental iterative

00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,590
looping fashion.

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:08,070
So, somehow, expressing this idea that the
results do not depend on in which order we

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,310
compute them.

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:16,200
One way to capture this idea would be
the equivalence that is shown here.

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
What it is saying is:

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:28,340
If I take some numbers from zero to n, and
then compute "f of a" (f a) on each element,

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:36,510
and then put the results in a list, it is
the same as if I first reversed this number

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:44,150
list, so I get the numbers from n to zero,
still computing f on each of those values

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,060
and then reversing the list again.

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,740
Of course, I need this second "reverse" in
order to arrange the results in the correct

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
sequence.

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,320
But the point is that *when* I compute a certain
"f" of a certain "a" doesn't influence the

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,100
values that I get.

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,900
Because of that, these two
lists will be the same.

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,860
If I take the numbers in opposite
order, I get the same values.

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,250
I just get them in the opposite order,
so I have to reverse again at the end.

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:26,370
And something like that wouldn't be
true for a for-loop, for example.

84 # slide
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:33,110
We can actually check this by looking at some
C-like or Java-like code or Python-like code

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,110
or whatever.

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,510
So, let's take two for-loops which roughly
correspond to the two directions in which

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,760
one could compute such an iteration.

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:51,830
In the upper two lines, we have a for-loop
which also goes from zero to n, incrementing

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,010
this loop counter and then always computing
"f of a", and then storing this in a list,

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,610
or an array in this case.

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,180
And here we have the opposite case, where we
go from n to zero and count downwards and

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,690
also put the results in a list or in an array.

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:14,030
But in C or Java it is not true that we can
always replace this by this, for various reasons,

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,750
like side effects, like things that the f-calls
could be doing in addition to computing values.

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,690
So, these are not two pieces of code that
are always interchangeable in a language like

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,690
Java or C.

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,380
Of course, there is also this loop indexing which
in itself is against the spirit of wholemeal

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
programming.

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,370
You could say: But well, at least with Java
iterators one could circumvent this, and

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,390
then it wouldn't look like array indexing.

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:45,950
But even then, these two pieces of code, or
similar pieces of code, wouldn't be equivalent.

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,250
And even if you have special situations, where
the f is very well behaved (it is not doing

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,820
any prints or reads or whatever, it is not
changing variable values), even then this

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,880
is more difficult to handle than an equation.

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,790
We can turn the equation from the previous
slide to this more general version where the

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,550
"reverse" switches to the other side.

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,460
This makes these two expressions more symmetric.

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,510
And of course, this doesn't
apply just to numbered lists.

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,380
We can take arbitrary lists, and this property
will still be true for whatever f and list

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,930
we have, and actually for a whole class
of functions in place of this "reverse".

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,690
And it can directly be used for manipulating
programs by algebraic transformations in the

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,620
same way as we have seen on previous occasions
in the lecture already with different laws.

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:47,370
So, this is what Richard referred to in the
other quote as lawful program construction.

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,080
To think about laws that the
functions in our programs satisfy.

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,330
They could also be used for QuickCheck testing.

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,770
There we are also interested in properties.

00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,750
And this could be a property that
is of interest in that context.

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:06,870
Also, this property is actually relevant
for the "isPalindrome" example again.

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:13,949
Probably, many of you have a solution to "isPalindrome"
(along with lower-/uppercase characters) which

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,170
somehow has something like "reverse" of a
list, where each element from a String has

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,430
been given to the 'toUpper'
or 'toLower' function.

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,230
And then if you see something like
that, you can replace it with this.

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,720
And maybe this makes the overall computation
more efficient because then you can change

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,120
or save some of the computation.

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,510
Or maybe the other way around.

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,650
Maybe you have the second line in your code,
and when you move the "reverse" outside of

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:45,300
this list, you realize that you can share
this expression as a common subexpression

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,110
with some other piece of
your function definition.

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,250
And then suddenly you have a more efficient
program, where you don't need to traverse

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,900
a list with toUpper or toLower two times.

00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,960
So, that is a benefit of having
laws like this available.

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:08,980
And it comes from how we
express our computations.

85 # slide
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,610
Just to drive home this point, let us consider
another example, which is somewhat artificial.

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,120
Let's assume we want to multiply each element
of an array or a list by its position in that

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,160
structure, and we want to sum
up all the resulting values.

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,520
That's an easy enough problem.

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:35,190
In whatever imperative language you know,
often you would solve it in a similar manner

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,190
as this one.

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,470
So, we need to have some declarations,
but these are not really the problem here.

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,970
Of course, we need to be sure about how we
start the result computation, how we initialize

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,970
this, etc.

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,970
But that is not the point here.

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,839
The point is that then we go through this
loop.

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,730
So, we need to make sure where we start; we
need to have an end condition, we need to

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,690
increment, and then we have our computation
that we do in each iteration of the loop.

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,560
And this looks about right.

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,720
This is a valid program for
computing what is written above.

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,740
But one could say, and should probably acknowledge,
that this suffers from the indexitis problem.

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,420
How does this manifest here?

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,529
For example, we need to know upfront how
array indices are counted in the language.

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:31,779
So, we could easily make an off-by-one error,
if we forget that we have to start counting

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:32,779
from zero.

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,700
We need to make sure that we
increment instead of decrement here.

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,870
We need to make sure that we have the right
end condition here, that we check that i is

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,650
smaller than n, and not, for example, that i
is equal to n, or smaller or equal to n, or

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,650
something like that.

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,120
So, in fact, there are at least three places
here where we could make an off-by-one error.

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,860
We could make a mistake here by
starting from the wrong start index.

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,880
We could make a mistake here by being off
by one, instead of comparing to n, comparing

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,350
to n - 1 or n + 1, for example.

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,760
And even here, there is this issue that we
have to make sure that we have the right idea

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,450
of how arrays are counted.

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,900
So, is the first entry 0,
or is the first entry 1?

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,970
So, how do we make the correct index access
here?

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:24,260
That is because of this solution being based on
index accessing and looping, in this explicit

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,570
fashion.

86 # slide
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,030
In contrast, let us look at how the
same problem could be solved in Haskell.

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:39,800
So, of course in Haskell, we could also write
a recursive function which essentially does

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,399
the same kind of iteration as the
for-loop does in the previous slide.

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,589
But actually, I would propose this as a solution
to this problem in a more wholemeal fashion

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,089
or spirit.

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,029
I would argue that this is very
nice, short and declarative.

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,390
So, it exactly expresses what we want to do.

00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,600
It takes this list.

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,000
It says that we want to basically combine
each list element with consecutive numbers.

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,360
We can express this by saying: let's pair
this by zipping with 0, 1, 2, ([0..]).

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,340
Then it takes all these pairs that it has
created and computes the multiplication, and

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,040
then this is summed up.

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,470
You can't really get it any shorter or more
declarative than this, in one go expressing

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,690
what's happening here.

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,300
Notice the difference in approach
from the previous solution.

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,220
There is no result variable that is somehow
overwritten again and again in a loop.

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,680
We don't need to have an explicit end condition.

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,870
There is no reference, even,
to the length of the list (n).

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,149
That is simply not needed here because the
zip will simply exhaust as many elements from

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,510
this infinite list as are needed
in order to have enough numbers.

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,880
So, there is no comparison against an end
value, like n or n - 1 or anything like that.

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,130
We also can't make any real errors this way.

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,010
This is just an expression
which computes something.

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:09,069
There is no looping with a loop condition, no
overwriting of result variables or anything

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,069
like that.

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,360
With this "zip" trick, it is also very interesting
that we don't need to know, in advance, how

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,270
many values we will need.

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,179
Because, simply, there will be as many consumed
from this infinite list as are needed for

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:28,020
our given finite list (assuming
that this list is finite).

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,679
You could, of course, argue that this is
cheating because I used the 'sum' function here.

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,600
So, maybe this is only short because I used
the 'sum' function instead of this repeated

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,390
accumulation of the addition.

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,110
But I would argue that this
is really beside the point.

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,160
On the one hand, it is a convenience function,
but even without having this available or

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,800
programmed by somebody else, it would have
been only a few keystrokes to express the

00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
summation.

00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
So, even if we don't have the 'sum' function, we
can write this with maybe ten more keystrokes.

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,280
We can also express the summation with a higher-order
function (see later), and we would still get

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,660
this nice declarative expression.

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,030
And even if in the C, Python, or Java
version, you would somehow allow yourself.

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,340
to use a convenient array sum function, that
wouldn't really have made the program from

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,340
the previous slide more
declarative or nicer to deal with.

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,430
So, if you actually sit down and try to think
about how you would program the for-loop based

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,100
version with a helper function for
summing, then you have to think:

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,670
What do I do with the array elements?

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,670
Where do I store them?

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,900
Do I overwrite my original array, so that then
I can call the 'sum' function on that array

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,230
(but then I have destroyed my input data)?

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,670
Or do I introduce a helper array in which
I first store all the multiplications and

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,970
then I use my 'sum' function on that helper
array, and then I have to discard it again?

00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:02,070
Things like this appear in this piecewise
approach with looping, whereas here we simply

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:12,600
have one expression which says all
there is to say about this problem.

87 # slide
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,010
So, if the presence or absence of the sum
function is not what really differentiates the two

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,780
cases, the Haskell version and imperative
version, then let's discuss what the actual

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,990
issues are here.

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,340
It's mainly about expressiveness and susceptibility
to change and refactoring, so how easy it

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,980
is to maintain or change this code.

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,290
Let's say we decided that actually the counting
of positions should start at 1 instead of

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,290
0.

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,809
We have the same computation again, but now we
actually want the first element to be multiplied

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,809
by 1.

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,580
This could certainly be done both for the
imperative and for the Haskell version.

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,650
Let's look at the C-like version.

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:58,240
There we had this loop before, and now we
could actually make this change by saying:

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,720
Well, we will actually start
at 1 with our index variable.

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,100
That also means we have to make sure that
we don't count to below n, but actually up

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
to n.

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,059
Otherwise, we would stop one step too early.

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,730
And we have to make sure that when we access
our arrays, since their numbering scheme hasn't

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,100
changed (simply because I want to compute
the first multiplication with 1 instead of

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,970
0, doesn't mean that somehow C has decided
that it will change how arrays are accessed),

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:33,360
while I multiply with 1, I still need to
access the array element at position 0.

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,080
So, actually, in order to make this change,
I had to change 3 places in this code.

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,010
It could be done in a different way, but
even then, there is this potential for error.

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,190
There are several places
where I can make an error.

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,080
I have to decide where I start?

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,340
Where do I stop?

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,230
How do I access the data structure elements?

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,910
So, there are several places where
I can make an off-by-one error.

00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:06,010
And everything has to fit together in order
to really express what I wanted to change

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,400
about my computation here.

88 # slide
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,230
In contrast, in the Haskell version, if I
want to make this change, I want to multiply

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,640
the first element by 1 instead
of 0, then what do I change?

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,799
I change one 0 into one 1
(from '[0..]' to '[1..]').

00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,260
That's all I need to do in order
to express this desired change.

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,330
I don't have to think about the loop end
condition, because there is no loop end condition.

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,280
And then I talked about n or n - 1 or n +
1.

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,850
I don't have to talk about this here either.

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,200
I only make the change that is relevant.

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:47,540
I also don't have to think about how my list
is indexed (how do I access the zeroth, or

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,640
first or second element?)
because there is no indexing.

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,510
Since I don't access elements of this list
by index, I don't have to change anything

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,510
about this.

00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,010
In that sense, this is the minimal
change, and the desired change.

00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,640
There shouldn't be more need for changes.

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:07,470
In that sense, one could say this is a more
maintainable program because we can make

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,100
desired changes in one local place.

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,150
Of course, I don't want to be lying; one could
argue that on the C version one could also

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,679
have made the change by a smaller edit.

00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,770
One could say: Even in the C version, I didn't
need to do what I did on the previous slide.

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,270
I could instead have changed
the multiplication down here.

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:39,260
So, leaving the array start and end as they
were, and somehow changing this multiplier,

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
here.

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,860
And accidentally, that would actually
also have led to the same behavior.

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,480
But I would argue, it's just
indexitis in a different form.

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,480
So, I still have to find the
place where to make this change.

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,590
It's somehow strange that now I have to think
that I multiply the (i+1)-th thing with the

00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,790
array at index i.

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,880
I have to make sure that I don't
make an off-by-one error here.

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:12,520
I avoided changing the loop iteration header
here, but it is not really nice that I have

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,980
these strange differences in what I
multiply with which array element.

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,590
So, I might consider this as a better change
rather than the one on the previous slide.

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,790
But even just the fact that there *are* these
two separate changes which lead to the desired

00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:34,160
behavior could also be seen as ground for
worry.

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,120
I want to change where I start my multiplying.

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,100
In the Haskell version, there is exactly one
place where I make this change, and it expresses

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,440
everything there is to express.

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,100
In the C version, there are several ways of
doing this, and each of these ways has the

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:54,179
potential for making errors by changing not
all of the 3 places, or only the wrong place

00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,980
where a change could be made.

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,870
So, that certainly takes more thinking by
the programmer rather than having this very

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,620
declarative way where we have exactly one
place that makes a difference between these

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,320
two versions of the program.

89 # slide
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,980
So, why is it that the C version has
to make all these clerical decisions?

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,860
Decisions that are not really significant from
an algorithmic perspective, but are simply

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,230
there because you have to make sure that you
get everything right about the loop start,

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,090
the loop end, and array indexing, etc.

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,090
Why is that?

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,181
Well, conceptually, it is because the C version
doesn't have a separation of the values that

00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:40,580
you want to enumerate and process, on the
one hand, and loop control on the other hand.

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,130
It is all one big mess.

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:48,160
In this example, it is not yet a *big* mess,
but things that have to be kept synchronized.

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,570
In larger examples, it really can become a
big mess to deal with all of these aspects

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,540
at once because there is no
separation of these concerns.

00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,309
In contrast, in the Haskell version,
we have this perfect separation.

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:05,660
It actually comes, in this specific
example, from this expression.

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:12,679
We express that we want to combine the things
from whatever list comes here with values

00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:20,429
starting from k and however far along we have
to go until we have processed all the values.

00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:24,470
This is somehow where the loop
control, if you want, is situated.

00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,720
But there *is* no explicit loop control.

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,200
You simply express what should be computed.

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,260
So, basically, this Haskell version
does not need explicit loop control.

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,740
It does not access data
structure elements by index.

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,440
That is again the point that I have made several
times now, that in Haskell, you should, and

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,680
can almost always, avoid the
use of indexing operators.

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,510
Because that's not how you think about data
structures in Haskell (by piecewise access

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,660
to individual elements).

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,070
You think about data structures as a whole,
and the operation that happens on the data

00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,750
structure as a whole.

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,200
So, we don't need to increment the loop counter.

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,570
We don't need to talk about the loop end condition
in the Haskell version, simply because of

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,360
this expressiveness, that particularly
in this case, infinite lists do have.

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,830
That is the point, that we can use an infinite
list basically as a structuring tool here,

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:22,070
and still, what will be computed is exactly
only as many elements from this list as are

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,070
needed.

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,419
So, this is somehow a concern that the evaluation
mechanism of the language performs for us.

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,920
We don't have to think
about this as a programmer.

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,930
That is what is helping us here and avoids all
these clerical decisions that the C version

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,930
has to make:

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,930
Where do I start counting?

00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,130
How to increment?

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,299
Where do I end counting?

00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,900
Am I sure that I have done exactly
as many iterations as I need?

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,030
Or one too many?

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,030
One too few?

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,660
How do I access elements by index?

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:55,380
All these things disappear if we express
the solution in this more declarative way.

90 # slide
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:03,040
Now, you could think this all is just propaganda.

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,540
At least, you could be suspicious.

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,650
Maybe I am fooling myself about efficiency.

00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:14,240
So, certainly, you could think the C code
is more efficient than my declarative code.

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,400
It seems like a reasonable thing to assume that,
for example, here, we probably compute this

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
extra list.

00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,510
So, this needs extra memory, and
then we traverse data several times.

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,470
Even when I discussed the C version with this
helper function "sum", I mentioned that we

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,760
would probably want to either overwrite
our first array or create a helper array.

00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,510
So, certainly in the Haskell
version, we also have these aspects.

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,730
So, certainly, this is less efficient.

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,920
So, we shouldn't go for this declarative version,
however nice I am trying to sell it to you.

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,520
Because this program is simply more efficient,
because it does a very tight loop and does

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,210
exactly what is needed to do.

00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,390
Maybe it is not nicely expressed because I
can make errors in all these places, but

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,650
at least it does it in an efficient way.

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:06,049
So, that could be your counterargument to
even trying to write a program like this,

00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:11,840
where everything is more maintainable because
we have a clearer separation of concerns.

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:19,300
That could be a concern
that you have at this point.

91 # slide
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,970
Well, actually no.

00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,070
That might seem like a valid
concern, but it doesn't really apply.

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,750
We do have compilers.

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:32,330
And compilers can translate declarative code
as you have just seen into a tight C-like

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,480
loop without using intermediate
data structures, just fine.

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,650
So, this is not really an issue.

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,039
Of course, the program might ultimately still
be less efficient than a handwritten C program,

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,160
but it's not on an order of magnitudes.

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,440
For example, the compiler can even
spot parallelization opportunities.

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,789
Thanks to the independent values aspect that
we discussed when comparing list comprehensions

00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:04,360
against for-loops, it is easier (in a program
as we have just seen) to spot places where

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,250
parallelization could happen; much simpler
than, for example, in a C program.

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:15,450
This also all has to do with the lawful program
construction aspect of the quote by Richard.

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,330
So, the fact that we have laws about our
programs can also be exploited by a compiler.

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:24,860
The compiler can apply laws to eliminate inefficiencies,
data structure traversals, data structures

00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
themselves.

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,090
This is actually what GHC is doing.

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,450
So, GHC isn't actually on its own introducing
parallelism, but it pays a lot of attention

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:38,320
to, for example, traversal of data
structures, and can eliminate many of them.

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,809
So, as a programmer, we can actually afford
to write nice declarative expressions because

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,610
we rely on the compiler to optimize our programs.

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:56,160
And the compiler can perform a lot of optimizations,
because of the laws that apply to our programs,

00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,650
and because of the purity.

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,250
So, everything is pure by default, unlike
in C, where we would need extra annotations

00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,820
and even then, the compiler cannot make as
many changes to the code as it might want

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,120
from a, so to speak, more
algorithmic perspective.

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,900
So, in a functional language, much more transformation
of programs is possible in an automatic fashion,

00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:27,340
because there is more semantic knowledge about
the programs than in an imperative language.

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,809
We could also talk more about refactoring.

00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,380
I don't want to do this at this point.

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,120
This was an excursion into this
subject of wholemeal programming.

00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:43,240
So, I don't want to spend too much
time of this week's lecture time on it.

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,129
Also, of course, you could argue or
wonder why I made this artificial example.

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:50,820
For presentation's sake, of course.

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,789
So, is this really representative
of real situations?

00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,650
My wholehearted claim is: Yes!

00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,360
I cannot prove this to you in this lecture.

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,270
But that's the experience that comes from
programming in a declarative fashion.

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,410
So, this is really representative.

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,210
It is not just something that
happened in this small example.

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,850
These differences are real.

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,029
And they are relevant.
