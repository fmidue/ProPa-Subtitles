00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:11,400
After this excursion on wholemeal programming,
let us consider a language feature again.

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,340
And actually, it's a language feature we have
already been using, and you have also already

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,670
been using implicitly in your exercises, without
probably noticing it unless you already know

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,670
about it.

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,410
It has to do with types as written here.

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,970
And we can actually also see the need and
the use for it when we look at lists again.

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:40,340
But anyway, the concept is more general and we
will also see applications and usages outside

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,290
the case of lists.

93 # slide
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,680
Let's remember that each
Haskell list is homogeneous.

00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,170
That means that we cannot have, in the
same list, elements of different types.

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,780
We can have a String as here
in the first example line.

00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,820
And that means we have a list of characters.

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,210
And we can have a list of Integers
and then we have numbers in that list.

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,530
But we can't have a list which contains
both a character and an Integer.

00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,811
It is not only that we don't
know what to write here.

00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:11,869
It is simply ill-typed.

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,360
So, it is not something that would be accepted
by a Haskell compiler or an interpreter.

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,350
It would simply reject this because it cannot
give it either of those two types, nor any

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,350
other type.

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,780
It is simply not allowed.

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,219
That is, in some sense, bad news, so to speak,
depending on how strict one wants typing to

00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,280
be.

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,649
At the same time, we have seen that functions
and operations on lists have been very flexible.

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:42,749
So, for example, we used "reverse" on Strings
and this gave us another list of characters,

00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,469
namely, the reversed String.

00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:49,619
But we also used the very same function 'reverse'
on Integers, and then we got a new Integer

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,619
list, etc.

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,209
Also, we had concatenation (++)
that could be used on Strings.

00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,630
It can be used on lists of Integers, etc.

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,119
And we have already depended
on this flexibility a lot.

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,789
Also, list comprehensions
are flexible in that sense.

00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:09,060
So, for example, we have used (and you have
used in the exercises) list comprehensions

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,510
both on the level of numbers or pairs of numbers,
but also on the level of Strings and maybe

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,459
even pairs of Strings, depending on
how you solved some of the exercises.

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:25,650
So, maybe you go back to some of the exercises
and look at the functions that you have used

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,290
on lists and ask yourself:

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,459
What kind of list was this actually?

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,239
And did it matter?

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,760
And in each case, it would have been
one of lists which are homogeneous.

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,260
But functions could be used
on lists of different types.

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,890
But *in* each list, the values
have to have the same type.

94 # slide
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,870
So, somehow, these two
aspects must be reconciled:

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,970
The rigidity saying that every list must
be homogeneous, which is very strong.

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,180
And on the other hand, flexible use of functions:
to be able to use something like concatenation

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,560
on different kinds of lists.

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,810
So, of course, we want to be able
to write something like this.

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,810
We have just seen this.

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,690
We want to concatenate lists of characters.

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,910
We want to concatenate lists of numbers.

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,770
Also for other functions like 'notElem' or
'elem', we want to be able to ask whether

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,909
2 (a number) is an element of a list of numbers,
or whether a character is an element of a

00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,219
list of characters (that is, of a String).

00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,959
But at the same time, we want
to prevent calls like this.

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,959
So, we don't want this.

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,110
We want ++ to work on Strings and numbers,
but we don't want it to work on both at the

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,110
same time.

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,080
Why don't we want this?

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,540
Well, if we did this, then even though this is
a homogeneous list, and this is a homogeneous

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,219
list, and ++ can be used on both kinds of lists,
then we would end up with a non-homogeneous

00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,219
list.

00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,330
If we would really append this, we would get
a list which contains characters 'a' and 'b'

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,500
and then numbers 3 and 4.

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,860
And that is not something that we want.

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,749
That would destroy the strictness
of "lists are always homogeneous".

00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:59,900
And similarly, we want to ask whether
a number is in a list of numbers.

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,000
We want to ask whether a character
is in a list of characters.

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,270
But we don't want to ask whether a
character is in a list of numbers.

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,579
And, no, we don't want this to evaluate
to False.

00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,999
Yes, in many languages, this would be okay,
and the answer would be False ('a' does not

00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,150
occur in this list [1,2,3]).

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,489
We don't want this.

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,109
We want this to be statically prevented.

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,639
So, this is not even a
question it makes sense to ask.

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,110
If these are of different types, then
'a' can't be an element of this list.

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,720
Simply because of the types not making sense.

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,430
So, we don't want this,
dynamically, to evaluate to False.

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:41,380
We want this, statically, to be
rejected as a not meaningful question.

95 # slide
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:48,229
So, what are the types then of
functions like those just seen?

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:54,710
Actually, suspiciously maybe, none of these
functions have been given types so far, neither

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,259
in the lectures, nor in the exercises.

00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,160
We have steered around this.

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,850
If we had, for example, told you what the
type of "reverse" is, then we might have had

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,750
to give you two types.

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:12,820
So, maybe: reverse on characters, which when
given a list of characters, gives you a list

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,360
of character values again; and maybe a "reverseInteger"
which, given a list of Integers, gives you

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
a list of Integers.

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,250
So, this is the kind of types that you have
seen so far and that occurred in type signatures

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,099
in the exercise templates.

00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:30,729
And if we had done something for reverse,
giving it as a top-level function, then we

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,660
would have had to decide which of the two
to choose, or maybe in one exercise, write

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,819
it like this, and in another
exercise, write it like that.

00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,972
That is clearly not something that is
somehow nicely maintainable in the long run.

00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,009
That is not how we want to program.

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,009
So, what instead?

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:50,510
Well, the point is, we can use variables at
the level of types as well: type variables.

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,130
So, the type of "reverse"
is neither this nor that.

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,750
The type of "reverse" is this.

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,020
And the "a" here is a variable, a type variable.

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,389
It uses the same syntax as an ordinary
variable, but now occurs in a type.

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:09,889
What it is saying is: 'reverse' is a function
from lists to lists, where actually the output

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,740
list type is the same as the input list
type, because we have the same variable here.

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,860
This is not the same as being untyped.

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,509
Let's consider the type of ++,
the concatenation operator.

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,099
It takes two lists and gives a list.

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,490
So, it is flexible in that sense, you
can give it two Strings and get a String.

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,961
But it is still impossible
to write something like this.

00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:31,669
So, this is not "anything goes".

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,180
It doesn't mean: any two
lists and I give you a list.

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,259
No, it is saying: Give me two lists of the
same type, and I also give you back a list

00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,259
of that type.

00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:46,580
And in that sense, this will be rejected,
because it is not two lists of the same type.

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,050
So, neither "reverse" nor the concatenation
care about the element type, but they still

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,379
care about the homogeneity of lists.

00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:01,419
So, in this case, for this reason, it is important
that these lists, even though they can be

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,720
of arbitrary types, they have
to be of the *same* type.

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,289
Otherwise, ++ will not be applicable.

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:14,889
And that is how this is rejected then, even
though ++ works both on Strings and on number

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,500
lists.

96 # slide
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,270
And actually, we have already seen a lot of
these examples, we simply didn't write down

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,270
the types.

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,580
So, if you go back to one of the slides where
I introduced some list functions (there was

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,600
a library of list functions that we used for
the first few exercises on lists), then most

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,099
of the functions that occurred there have
such type variables if you actually write

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,099
down their types.

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:45,060
So, for example, the 'head' function is a
function from lists to not lists, but elements.

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,200
The 'head' function doesn't give you back
a list.

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,510
It gives you back something
which occurs in the list.

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,520
That's why we have here: a
list of "a"s to one "a".

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,539
Whereas the 'tail' function, for example,
given a list of "a"s gives you a list of "a"s.

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:00,370
Because it takes away just one element
and then still gives you back a list.

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,759
Similarly for "last" and "init".

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,669
All these functions are polymorphic.

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,669
That's what a type variable means: "polymorphic"
is what I have here as the heading.

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,879
I didn't yet mention that notion, but this
kind of type is called polymorphic type,

00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,919
because they can take many forms, basically.

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,180
Working with data of different
forms, in that sense, "polymorph".

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,450
And of course, a function doesn't have
to be polymorphic in *everything*.

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:31,039
For example, the 'length' function doesn't go
from a list of "a"s to "a" like the "head"

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,039
function.

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,980
It goes from a list of "a"s to Int
because the output is definitely a number.

00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,829
The 'length' function is polymorphic; it works
on any kind of lists, but it always returns

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:41,899
an integer number.

00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,710
Likewise, there is a function for
checking whether a list is empty.

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,220
And again, this works on any kind
of list, so, a list of "a"s here.

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,630
But it returns a Boolean value.

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,950
It doesn't return "a" or a list or whatever.

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,810
It returns a Boolean value.

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,170
So, the type variable is really used for showing
which parts of inputs and outputs are to be

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,240
used flexibly.

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,130
And this is *not* flexible because
the length must be a number.

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,660
This is *not* flexible because the outcome of
such a predicate check should be a Boolean

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
value.

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,279
Okay, and polymorphism can also occur nested.

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,990
For example, the 'concat' function: it was for
concatenating (possibly) more than two lists.

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,910
So, you give it a list of lists of something,
and it returns a list of those somethings,

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,100
because one list level is reduced.

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,870
One nesting level of the list is eliminated.

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,510
So, from a list of lists, it goes to just
a list.

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,230
And what are the entries in those lists
in a list, and in the outcome list?

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,230
Something!

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,430
But the same on the input
and on the output sides.

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,130
In concrete applications of such polymorphic
functions, you don't see the polymorphism

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,130
anymore.

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,620
So, if you apply, for example, the "head"
function to a String, then of course, it is

00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,120
not anymore polymorphic.

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,030
At this point, if you give it a concrete list
which is a String (so it is a list of characters),

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,670
at that point, it's clear that
this "a" must be characters.

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,670
And then what is the outcome?

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,730
A character, of course.

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,130
So, then this instantiation happens,
and "a" becomes a concrete type.

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,240
And then also the output type is clear.

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,420
It must be Char because this goes from
lists of something to this something.

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,890
So, since a String is a list of
characters, the outcome is a character.

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,860
As a side note, actually, these types, if
you really look them up in an interpreter

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,952
session, for example, they have even
more polymorphic types than you see here.

00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:38,089
So, you get something with some additional
type constraints, like "Foldable".

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:40,389
But we ignore this in this lecture.

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,700
So, we consider these functions on lists.

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,100
And the polymorphism that interests us is
the polymorphism in the list entries, not

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,790
the polymorphism over the list structure (replacing
this with some other data structure than lists).

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,030
That's not the kind of polymorphism
that's of interest to us.

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,630
So, we talk about these type variables,
in this case, the list entries.

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:10,260
But that also applies to other
data structures, later on.

97 # slides
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Also on the input side, a function
need not be polymorphic in everything.

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,050
Just as the 'length' and 'null' functions are
not polymorphic in the output, a function could

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,930
also be non-polymorphic in the arguments,
or maybe in some of its arguments.

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,620
So, let's look at some further examples.

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,930
This is the infamous and
undesirable list indexing operator.

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,070
It takes a list, and it works on any kind
of lists, and it takes a number as an index,

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,480
and it returns an element of the original
list.

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,670
That's why we have a list of "a"s, an integer
(which must really be an integer; it can't

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,290
be a Bool or something strange),
and the result will be an "a".

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,600
Or the 'take' and 'drop' functions.

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,149
They, again, take a number (because you must
tell them how much they should take or drop

00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,889
from the input list), and then you have a
list.

00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,040
And that list is polymorphic; it doesn't matter
whether we take from a list of Strings, a

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,480
list of characters, a list of
numbers, or whatever, it always works.

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,190
But the first argument must be a
number and not something strange.

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:19,230
For example, the 'splitAt' function, which
had to be used in one of the exercises, again

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,970
takes a number because you have to tell it
where it should split a list; then you give

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,970
it a list.

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,970
And what do you get back?

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,970
Two lists.

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,850
Of course, two lists of exactly
the same type as the input list.

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,779
You can't give it a String and get back a
list of characters (a String) and a list of

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,779
something else.

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,380
If you give it a String,
you get back two Strings.

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,370
If you give it a list of numbers, you
get back two lists of numbers, etc.

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,709
That is also important, that in the
output you can have several things.

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:53,550
And, for example, in this case they must have
the same type, but flexibly in the input (in

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,440
the element type), but the same
element type for both lists.

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,040
And then, you can again have the same question:

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,540
What if you have several input lists
and want to be flexible in that?

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,730
We talked about ++ already, but let's
also talk about the 'zip' function.

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,810
So, what about this?

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,950
The idea was:

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,750
You give it two independent lists, and
what you get back is a list of pairs.

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,209
So, what should be the typing of this?

98 # slide
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,100
Well, let's see.

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,170
Of course, the lists that you give it have
to be homogeneous lists because every list

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,430
in Haskell is homogeneous.

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,130
However, unlike in the case of the ++ concatenation
operator, they don't have to be the same kind

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,130
of lists.

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,899
We have actually used this already.

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,860
We zipped things like lists of
numbers and lists of characters.

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,389
I don't know whether that already occurred
in exercises, but you can do this.

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:53,500
You can take a list of numbers and a String
and get back a list of pairs of numbers and

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
characters, for example.

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,240
How does this work?

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,560
Unlike in the case of ++, we do not only want
to allow "ab" ++ "cd" and numbers ++ numbers,

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,730
and disallow any mixed use.

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,700
For "zip", we actually want to
allow also all these combinations.

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,579
So, zipping two Strings, zipping two lists
of numbers, but also zipping, for example,

00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,589
a String and a list of numbers.

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,600
So, apparently the type must be different
than the type of ++ because for ++ we said:

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,550
We give it two lists of the same element type,
and it gives back a list of the same kind.

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,380
In the case of "zip", it would give back
a list of pairs probably, but let’s focus

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,639
on the input side here.

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,610
So, the type of "zip" cannot look like this,
because if it did, then by the same argument

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,611
that I used before to say that the type of
++ statically rejects something like this,

00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:48,019
also this would be rejected.

00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:54,449
But there is no need to reject this because
zipping conceptually also works if you give

00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,750
it two different kinds of lists.

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,769
Each list must be homogeneous, but
they could be of different types.

99 # slide
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,730
Well, the type should look like this.

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,639
So, again, it is using type
variables, but now more than one.

00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,259
To express that the two input lists
need not be the same kind of lists.

00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,410
So, if you had "a" and "a" here, this would
mean we don't care what kind of list it is,

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,640
but it must be the same list type in
the first and the second argument.

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,779
What we are saying here is:

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,980
We don't care what kind of lists we get; we
don't even care whether the first and the

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,290
second list have the same type.

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,960
So, they must each be a homogeneous list,
but they could be of different element types.

00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,410
And what is the outcome?

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,980
It is a list of pairs.

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,190
And in these pairs, always the first component
has the type as coming from the first input

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:51,750
list, and the second component of each pair
has the type coming from the second argument

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,110
list to "zip".

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,019
The "a" and "b" *can* be the same type,
but they don't *have* to be the same type.

00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:02,010
In that sense, we can more flexibly
use this than for example the ++.

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,600
This is important: Different type variables
can be, but do not have to be, instantiated

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
by different types.

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,750
So, this added flexibility doesn't
prevent uses like: String and String.

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,079
This is still allowed.

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,319
But also String and a list of numbers.

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,160
Hence, now all of these calls make sense.

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,620
If we zip two Strings, then this "a" becomes
Char and this "b" becomes Char, and the outcome

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,100
list is a list of pairs of Char and Char.

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,470
If you zip two lists of numbers, then this
"a" becomes Int and "b" becomes Int and the

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,009
outcome is a list of pairs
of integers and integers.

00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:46,889
And finally, if we zip a String and a list of
numbers, then this "a" becomes Char because

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,940
this is a list of characters, this "b" becomes
Int, because this is a list of integers.

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,350
And what is the outcome list?

00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:00,720
It's a list of pairs of "a = Char" and "b
= Int".

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,870
That's why this now makes sense, whereas still
a mixed call for the ++ function does not

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,640
make sense because there the requirement
was a list of "a" and a list of "a".

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,030
So, if you try to use it like this, then the
compiler would have to decide whether this

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,920
"a" variable is Char or Int.

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,210
It cannot be both at the same time, but it
would have to be both because this is a list

00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,770
of "a"s being characters and this
is a list of "a"s being integers.

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,262
So, the different type variables here prevent
this problem for "zip", but for ++ we definitely

00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:34,330
want that both are of the same type.

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,700
That's why the "a" occurs twice
in the type of the ++ operator.

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:48,650
Unfortunately, it is not necessarily the case
that type error messages by the compiler are

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,260
as clear as the comments here.

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,780
Maybe it is not always as directly visible
from the type error messages if you make a

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:03,680
type error: what was
expected, and what was found.

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,600
But at least on calls like this,
you can work this out on your own.

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,440
With more complex calls, maybe you need some
help or some digging into different expressions

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,800
to find out where the compiler wasn't happy.

100 # slide
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:28,710
Of course, you might have seen something like
this before: types like this, which can express

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:35,190
that a function is flexibly used over different
element types of a collection type, for example.

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,020
Probably not if you come
from an untyped language.

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,600
But if you come from a language like Java
or C# or C++, maybe you have seen something

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,760
like Generics in Java.

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,010
So, this is Java Generics syntax, but similarly
it is available in other languages of that

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,560
family.

00:18:51,560 --> 00:19:00,430
This T parameter that you would have in a
generic collection method signature corresponds

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,430
to the "a", roughly.

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,970
So, this is saying something like: For any
T, I have this "reverse" method maybe, or

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,190
a static method, which given a list, which is
a list over something of this type T, gives

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,830
back a list of something of the same type
T.

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,690
And again, the T here is used more than once,
to express that this must always be the same

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,690
type.

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:27,320
So, this corresponds very much directly to
the "reverse" annotation here that takes lists

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,990
and gives back lists and they
have to be of the same type.

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,480
This is not somehow happenstance, that
this also occurs in other languages.

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,890
But it's also not the case that Haskell is
somehow modeled along these examples, these

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,520
languages.

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,970
The opposite is true.

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,530
Haskell and similar typed functional languages
had this feature much earlier than all the

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,070
object-oriented languages, for example.

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,970
And actually, the Java Generics were designed
by a person (Phil Wadler) who had previously

00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,560
been a designer of Haskell.

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,850
So, really the direction is from here to
there and not in the opposite direction.

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,450
Also, in these languages like Java, C#, etc.,
they have different design and implementation

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:16,850
decisions surrounding this polymorphism feature,
and I would claim that the original version

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,680
that appears in languages like Haskell or
ML is the cleanest and mathematically most

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,700
pleasing one.

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,220
In the object-oriented languages, certain compromises
have been made to integrate, for example, Generics

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,030
with other language features, that were not
necessary as compromises in the more pure

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:39,460
setting of functional languages.

101 # slide
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,530
One aspect that distinguishes polymorphism
in Haskell and its functional programming

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,160
predecessors from those other
languages is type inference.

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:55,300
Not only did polymorphism occur much earlier in
these languages, but they have type inference.

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,170
We need not declare the polymorphism.

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,200
The compiler will always infer the most general
type automatically if we don't write down

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
a type.

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,650
So, for example, for the 'reverse' function
we don't have to declare that it doesn't care

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:12,330
about what the element type
is in a list given to it.

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,470
Actually, from the definition of the
function, the compiler will work this out.

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,130
That's different than in Java, for example.

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,270
Let's not look at the list functions, even
though for all of them, again, the compiler

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,390
would work out the polymorphic types
even if we didn't write them down.

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,030
Let's look at some simpler examples.

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,700
So, for example, if we write down a function
like this: 'f (x,y) = x', and we don't say,

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,040
are these numbers, are these
characters, what are they?

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,280
Then the compiler will infer: Well,
this is the type that you see here.

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,470
So, the compiler will say:

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,650
Obviously, this goes from a pair to an element.

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,680
And it doesn't really matter what
types these elements of the pair have.

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,380
So, it is pairs of "a"s and
"b"s, and the outcome is "a".

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,550
Why is it "a"?

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,620
Because the function projects
to the first component.

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,790
From this, the compiler knows and infers that
this is polymorphic; the outcome is of the

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:16,220
same type as the first component of the pair
that is given, and the second component may

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
be a different type.

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
It doesn't *have* to be a different type.

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,310
But it *may* be a different type.

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,940
That's why a different
type variable is used here.

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,230
And likewise, for the 'zip' function the compiler
would also figure out automatically that the

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,260
two input lists can be of different types,
unlike in the case of the ++ operator.

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,360
So, if this is not declared, the
compiler will still work it out.

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:44,160
Maybe a bit surprising if you see it first,
is that in a case like this, the compiler

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,790
will actually force that
two types must be the same.

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:53,060
So, if we write a similar function, which
somehow says "if pi > 3 then x else y", then

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,180
again, the compiler will figure out that x
and y can be anything, so it is going to use

00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,240
a type variable.

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,250
Because if you look at this if-then-else,
nothing is really done with the x and y, so

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,910
there is nothing that forces
them to be numbers or so.

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,960
Clearly, pi is a number, but
x and y may be anything.

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,370
And something of type x or
y will come out of this.

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,490
But actually, the compiler in this case forces
the two values to be of the *same* type.

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,540
Why is that?

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,210
Because the compiler doesn't try to mathematically
prove that pi is something greater than 3.

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,790
Of course, in this specific
case, that is very simple.

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,060
So, the compiler could somehow evaluate this.

00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:41,010
But in general, we could have any mathematical
expression here, and then the typing of if-then-else

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,890
is: here must be a condition, and the then-
and else-branches must have the same type.

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,640
Since in this case, x or y, one of the two
pair components, is given back, in the then-

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,500
and else-branches, so they
must be of the same type.

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,490
Otherwise, this wouldn't be statically
safe to know what the outcome type is.

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,270
So, in this case, these must be the same.

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,330
But the compiler works this out.

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,480
So, really, the point here is:

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,290
You can write down the function definition, and
the compiler will find out the least restrictive

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,560
conditions on the types of the inputs and
outputs so that it always works, and it always

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
makes sense.

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,550
That doesn't mean that you should, from now
on, forget about writing type signatures.

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:25,250
Often it is still useful to write your own
type signatures, be they polymorphic or not.

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,180
Simply to express what you expect about your
function, and then the compiler can compare

00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,740
this, and will compare this,
to what the compiler works out.

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,050
And you can write down a more specific type.

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,500
So, if you say: I want my f-function to be from
pairs of integers and integers to integers,

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,710
then that's fine.

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,950
The compiler won't complain about this.

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,680
The compiler will complain if you claim more
generality for your functions than they really

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
provide.

00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,490
The compiler will not complain if you give
a more specific type than the one that the

00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,090
compiler would have inferred on its own.

102 # slide
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:06,830
Another pleasing aspect of polymorphism in a
language like Haskell is that this polymorphism

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,400
has really interesting semantic consequences.

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,720
We can see this if we recall from earlier
in the lecture the following law, where I

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,390
talked about interchanging the order in which
we reverse a list or apply functions to the

00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,940
elements of the list.

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,400
So, you probably remember this law from then.

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,960
Maybe surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly
to you, this holds not just for arbitrary

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,130
f and lists.

00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,850
So, I said we could put any list here.

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,620
We can take any function here.

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,400
Actually, also the "reverse" can be exchanged
for something else, namely for any function

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,710
of the same type.

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,190
So, "reverse", we now know, has this type:
list of "a"s to list of "a"s, for whatever

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,390
"a" is.

00:25:53,390 --> 00:26:00,290
And actually, this law doesn't depend on what
"reverse" is doing, that it is reversing the

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,290
list.

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:06,490
We could replace this by any function g which
has the same type as this here, and the law

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,350
would still hold, no matter how g is defined.

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,330
And that is, I would say,
a bit surprising at least.

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:18,130
So, you could maybe think about what functions
you can think of that have the same type.

00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,030
We have actually already seen some.

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,530
The 'tail' function and the 'init'
function, for example, have this type.

00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:29,290
But also other functions like taking the first
5 elements of a list, for example, also have

00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,290
this type.

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,580
And also other functions that you can think
of.

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,210
And whatever of these functions you plug into
the two places of "reverse" here, this law

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,290
will hold.

00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:43,300
Much more generally than for specific for-loops,
where you could also maybe find a law.

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,140
So, this is a law that comes almost for free.

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:53,870
It applies very freely, and depending
on just the type of this function here.

00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,330
And since I mentioned earlier that laws like
this can be used for program optimization,

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,970
this also means that there is a lot of potential
for doing this in a compiler, for example.

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:15,040
Because you can deduce laws from the
types of functions, like in this case.

103 # slide
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,230
Let's briefly return to how this was
formulated in the C-like imperative setting.

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:29,320
Actually, the "reverse"-claim I just discussed,
earlier occurred in the context of comparing

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,890
these two for-loops, and comparing
them to a Haskell version.

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,350
And then this "reverse"-claim came about.

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,170
And at that point in the lecture, I already
mentioned that in an imperative setting, these

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,490
loops may not be equivalent, depending,
for example, on what the f is doing.

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,700
So, there could be a difference here.

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,170
And now we know that even if they *are* equivalent
in certain situations, for example, because

00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,920
we know more about the f and about what's
happening, at least they are not as general.

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,590
This "reverse"-claim is much more general.

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,710
Now that we also know that the "reverse" function
can be replaced by any function from lists

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,400
to lists, polymorphically; that
is certainly not true for this.

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,810
So, these two loops might be interchangeable
in certain situations that we can check with

00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,800
some work, but they do not generalize in the
way that this "reverse"-claim generalizes

00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,640
to any function of the same type.

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,400
For any specific function like "tail", you
could also see, well, what does this mean

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,870
in the context of for-loops?

00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,410
Is there a corresponding result
in an imperative setting?

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:41,570
Maybe we can work this out, but we don't
get a general law like in the case earlier.

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,270
Also, Generics don't give you this.

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,050
So, even though Generics in Java, somehow,
correspond to polymorphic types, they don't

00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,360
give you this kind of results.

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,230
This is all nicer in a setting like Haskell.

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,470
And that is not just an accident.

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,380
It comes from the expression-based character
of the language, where we can talk about laws

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,140
between expressions.

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,470
It comes from the type discipline.

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,730
It comes from the mathematical basis, that
everything is compositionally designed and

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,850
defined.

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:22,530
So, in that sense, it is really something given
as a plus on top of the other expressiveness

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,710
that we already have.
