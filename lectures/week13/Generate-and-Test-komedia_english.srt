00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,610
Next, I would like to discuss with you
the so-called Generate-and-Test Principle

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:16,020
with you. This is a simple and
in Prolog very well implementable

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,620
algorithmic approach. I would
like to motivate this first by a

00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:29,880
small example. Let us imagine that we have our
Prolog lists, with which we have already worked now

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,640
with which we have already worked, for which we have
learned several in order to append lists to each other,

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,675
to take them apart, to search for elements
in lists, etc. Now we have the task:

00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:47,610
We would like to sort lists. So, the idea
is, we would like to have a predicate,

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,340
to sort something. Of course, that has two arguments.
The first argument we would assign, for example

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,040
with an arbitrary list, which
is more interesting, not sorted.

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:11,670
So, its elements not sort of ascending through. And we
would like to have, if we have the sortingTo predicate

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,580
and here an R, a result list
as a variable in that case,

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:26,160
then we would like to have as a response
for R get the sorted list as assignment.

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,370
So, the same elements, but in sorted
order. This is a classical problem.

00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,370
Also, a very old, in computer science often
treated, algorithmic problem. We have a

00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:48,990
list and would like to sort it. This does
none of the predicates we have seen so far.

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,320
How can we proceed? Now we can say
we probably try to define a recursive

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,630
predicate to define. We could say yes, how to sort
the empty list is sorted and then maybe how it is

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,780
with non-empty lists. For this, we would have
to have a very concrete algorithmic idea.

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,110
At the latest, when you [as Komedia students] hear the programming lecture
in the next semester or the next year, you will probably also discuss

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,860
algorithms for sorting, for example. Or
maybe you have already done that in school,

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,035
if you had computer science classes. And there
are many different approaches to sorting a list.

00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:29,520
But currently, we don't want to deal with
that yet. First, we should establish what

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,960
exactly we actually want. It's easy to say.
"I want to have a sorted list." But we are a

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,800
logic lecture, so perhaps it would be clever to
be very precise about what that actually means.

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,480
And not just verbally: "The elements
must be in the right order."

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,540
So, a possible approach here would be,
first, to specify logically what it

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,590
means that a list is sorted. So,
let's take care of the "What?"

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:07,140
instead of the "how?". How should the list be sorted?
First, we could think about the properties that the

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,430
properties the result list should have. This
can be expressed conveniently in Prolog using a

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,440
predicate. A one-digit predicate. While the
is a two-digit predicate, which says for the

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,350
list must come out, so to speak. There is
the Question, when is a list sorted at all?

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,240
A property of a single list. So, this list, for
example, is not sorted. The result list here is

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,060
sorted and should be. So, we talk
what this property of a list is to

118 # slide
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,170
be sorted. And it is actually not difficult
to express in Prolog. It is first of all

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:50,400
a recursive predicate. Then there are base cases. So,
e.g. the empty list is always sorted. A one-element

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,810
list is always sorted, no matter what the element is in
there. Therefore, the occurrence of an anonymous variable.

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:02,460
An arbitrary list is sorted, especially a
list that contains at least two elements.

00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,340
So, we decompose here similarly as
we did, for example, in the exercises

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,210
for the example where we wanted to have the first element of
a list we want to have here the first two elements of the

00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:22,690
Xs list. So, we decompose Xs using the append predicate
into the first two elements X and Y and any remaining list.

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:29,020
It could be empty. Ys could be
empty. Then Xs just consisted of

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,450
exactly two elements. So, the next larger
case, there are no elements or one element.

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,050
So, we decompose it like this. In this way, we grab so to
speak the first two list elements and then we can compare

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:48,730
if they are in the right order. So, if now the
first X, the first element =< the second one,

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,590
then there is at least a chance that the list as
a whole is sorted. If this is not fulfilled here,

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:01,390
then the original list was not sorted. And we have
"and". We decompose that, and it must hold that X =< Y.

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,840
So, if that doesn't hold, then the list Xs is not sorted. However,
if X =< Y, then it still doesn't mean that the list is sorted.

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,000
We still have to worry about the rest. So, the obvious thing to do
is, we might say, "The rest of the list still needs to be sorted."

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,830
But that's not enough. We can think about that: It must
also still be true that the Y relates appropriately to

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,920
the residual elements. One way to
say: "After we have checked that

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,110
the first =< the second element, we simply add the
second element back to the residue list. So, we form

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,500
with it the list Zs. These are then all list elements
without the first X and then we check if this

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,280
remaining list is sorted. This is then the recursive call." So, use
isSorted here, although at the same time we also define isSorted

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,560
at the same time. But of course, we use that on a
different argument, on a different list. And if we look at

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,820
what these two append calls in particular
mean: that Zs is shorter than Xs.

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:04,870
That's why there's a real chance here that this recursive
predicate works in a meaningful way. So, this says,

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,170
when a list is sorted. In fact, we can check
this. For example, if we call this for our

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,200
list [4,2,6,9,1], then it comes out that it is
not sorted. For the result list, the desired

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:27,220
result list [1,2,4,6,9] it would come out that it is
sorted. What is important here is first on the slide, how

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,080
this is defined here. In particular, that the
recursive call cannot simply be made on Ys,

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,180
but on a list that still contains the Y. You can
think about why that would be a problem otherwise.

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,250
For example, if we were to ignore the first two
elements of this list and had the list [6,9,1],

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:50,950
and put these into the isSorted, then X
= 6 and Y = 9. If we checked now only

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:58,090
that X =< Y, then this would be fulfilled. 6 =< 9 is
true. And we would then check if the rest list Ys sorted,

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,130
then it would be, because [1] is sorted. And
then we would claim that [6,9,1] is sorted.

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:09,370
However, if we say as we do here: 6 <= 9
must hold and then append 9 back to the

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,983
list, which then results in this list, and this list must
be sorted then it turns out very quickly and correctly,

00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:24,370
that this list or even this rest list is not sorted
here. So, that (you can think about it a little bit or

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,650
you can try it out) would be a reasonable
description of the property that a list is sorted.

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,210
That provides us with the "what?", so to speak. We want the
result list to be sorted. This does not tell us anything about

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:43,810
the "How?". We have a list, it is not sorted. We know
what a list has to look like in order to be sorted.

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,840
That doesn't tell us how we algorithmically
go from the unsorted list to the sorted list.

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,430
So, the "How?" would be the next problem.
How can we get such a suitable list,

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,900
or produce it? We don't want
to have just any sorted list.

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,910
We have an original list, and we would like to have a
sorted list that has somehow emerged from this list.

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:15,250
We don't want to have just any such list. That
would be easy, we would just take the empty list.

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:21,310
It is always sorted. Now you can proceed very naively and say:
"Actually, I just want to have a permutation of the original list,

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,890
that is sorted." Which is sorted in ascending order.
I have an original list. It may not be sorted.

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:32,440
I would like to have a permutation of that source
list with the additional property that what

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:41,760
comes out after the permutation is sorted.
You can actually write that in Prolog.

119 # slide
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,700
Elsewhere, we have already simply put requests in
queries/queries or in predicates and then let Prolog search for

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:55,830
solutions. So, you could now proceed very naively
and say: "I would like to sort Xs to Ys." I do that

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,660
by saying: Ys must be a permutation of Xs.
We remember: We had seen for the permutation

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:09,330
we had seen a predicate. I had defined that on the
slides. But I had also said that there was also a

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,570
predefined permutation predicate
with the same name in Prolog.

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,460
That means we don't have to add what's on
the slide, here at all. We can simply use the

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,850
predefined permutation predicate. This
actually gives us for a given input list

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,150
all permutations. Here we had now a sorted input
list and the permutations of it were not necessarily

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,650
all sorted. Now we want to have this the other way
around. We give some list that is not necessarily sorted.

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:43,620
Then we would get all the permutations. Like this:
All enumerated. All permutations of that input list.

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:53,220
And then from the results we want to pick
out one that is sorted. In the normal case,

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:04,930
or always, this will even be unique. There is
exactly one sorted equivalent to each list.

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,560
So, we say, to sort Xs to Ys, we permute Xs to Ys.
This would also give results which are of course

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,580
not correct. Just are any permutations. But
then we still say, this Ys must be sorted.

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:22,150
In the sense of this predicate, which we
have also written in Prolog expresses that.

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,280
That is, the work here is in the
description, what we actually want. Here we

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,470
simply say: We would like to have a permutation, for which
we already have a predicate. And it has to be sorted.

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,470
In fact, we can proceed naively like that.
This works. We could now call this predicate

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,380
which consists only of this rule. So, also, it is
not recursive in any way. The sortingTo predicate is

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:51,730
not recursive. It just says what we want it to say. And
in fact, that would work. We could call this in Prolog

00:10:51,730 --> 00:11:00,460
and actually get the result we want here. This is, as
I said, a little naive, but surprisingly versatile.

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:08,290
In fact, behind it is just the
general Generate and Test principle.

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:16,300
What is the idea here? We want to somehow have a rule
on input. In Prolog, everything is always an input,

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,520
once we write that as a predicate. Here it
doesn't say Ys is the result of sort Xs,

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,830
but Xs and Ys are any arguments, about which
there are conditions. And maybe we call

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,720
this later so that we specify Xs and search for
R. It doesn't have to be that way. We want to

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,570
first formulate what it means at all, that
Ys and Xs are in a desired relationship.

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,040
And of course, the point is that we have some problem
(e.g. the sorting problem) and we are trying to

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,720
we try to write down a rule which returns true
exactly if we had a valid solution to the problem.

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,420
That was the task here in the end, to write a
predicate which correctly expresses when Ys is a

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,310
sorted version of Xs. And we have divided
this into two parts. Here the two parts are

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,250
very obvious, because on the right side of this
desired rule, I have exactly two calls. And that is

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:13,180
there is the first part here. That would be the
"generate" part. It somehow generates solution candidates.

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:20,830
And very many in the case of the permutation. And then
there is the "test part", which filters out those candidates

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:29,380
that are desired. So, somehow there is a
search space. All possible permutations

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,440
of the original list would have been our search space here. And
there is the test part, which checks for elements of the search space

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,510
whether the solution condition is true. So, the condition, which
must be fulfilled. In this case, we wanted to sort something.

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:51,160
So, the problem here was the sorting problem and the condition
for that was that the list that comes out must be sorted.

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:58,480
Of course, that can be more than one condition.
Here it's so obvious that there is exactly one

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,880
predicate for the generate part and for the
test part. In general, this can also be

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:18,640
several predicate calls or conditions. Let's
go into this in more detail on a few more

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,630
examples, or see it in action again.
These are first very simple, artificial

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,850
examples, where we can simply see this distinction
or this principle in action several times,

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:38,440
to be able to identify when we have
such a generate-and-test solution.

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:46,330
And then in later videos, I'll make more illustrative
or more useful examples. More interesting

120 # slide
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:56,710
examples, bigger example. Let's
imagine the following task or imagine.

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,220
is given to them as a task: Let it be determined all
the ways in which one can score a total of 15 points by

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,390
rolling a dice three times, you can get a total
of 15 points. So, we have three dice or one die

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,410
which we roll three times. The result
is a number between one and six.

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,960
At the end, we add them up and the question is: In which way
could it be that exactly 15 points were scored at the end?

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:27,700
What would generating mean here?
Generating here would mean to generate all

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,000
candidates, what could have come out of these three dice rolls.
could have come out. There's nothing there about permuting.

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,380
There's nothing that's permuted in any way. We
just need to have all the combinations that these

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,170
three dice could have as numbers. And then the
testing is certainly the verification that there are

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:53,050
15 points that have come out. And if we follow exactly
this strategy we can actually write that as a query.

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,150
We could also wrap that up in rules. I do
that now with these simple examples, so

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,110
that I just always directly write the query,
which could be entered promptly in Prolog.

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,960
Of course, you could also write a predicate "solution"
with the arguments and then what I now have requested,

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,790
take as the right side this predicate and calling
the predicate would then return the solutions.

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:19,720
I'm going through this now, so I'm going to specify that directly
as a query. And then you can translate this almost verbatim,

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,420
what I've just indicated. So, of course we have
to consider what the possible numbers of dice are.

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:34,450
It just says dice. I mean a W6. So, there are the results [1,2,3,4,5,6].
So, I can say that's sort of a component of my search space.

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:42,040
That's not directly the search space. There are
not only 6 candidates, but we have three letters.

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,720
So, there's kind of 6 × 6 × 6 candidates if we
think combinatorially about it. And how can I

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,200
generate the search space? I can say: Let A be
the result of my first dice roll. And that must be

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,480
a number from one to six. So, an element of this list.
And the member predicate I had introduced last week

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:07,060
And mentioned that that's where we check if A is
in W. Or if we call that not with concrete values,

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:13,900
but with variables, then all possibilities
are considered, how A can be from W.

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,540
That is, if W is a six-element list, then alone this
call here will already lead to six different candidates.

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:26,170
The same happens for B and C. So, let B and
C be the numbers of the second and third

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:32,590
roll. And these are also elements of this
six-element list. That means, with these

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:39,220
three calls here I span the search space.
I draw, so to speak, A, B, and C each

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,290
independently of each other from this list. And
then I check whether the sum of A, B, and C is 15.

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:54,330
Now I have to explain briefly what this means here.
This is the so to speak arithmetic calculation

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,850
and comparison of the results. There is a small difference.
This W = here in front, that calculates nothing.

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,110
It's not about arithmetic, not about numbers, not
about adding, multiplying or anything like that.

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:12,420
Here it is simply said: The variable W is equal to this list.
I don't want to do that here. I don't want to write here:

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:20,130
A + B + C = 15. A + B + C, these are
just any numbers and + is only a symbol.

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,740
So, there will be no calculation there. So, what I say here
is in fact: Whatever is written here, for concrete A, B, C

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,410
there is a sum. This sum is to be calculated and
then with the constant 15. And if I want to do this

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,210
I can't use the normal =. This simple
symbol. I need this special symbol

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,390
which makes arithmetic comparisons. The left and
right side calculates (like a pocket calculator)

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:51,790
and then looks if the same number came out. Then
I would have solved this problem here. You can

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:59,830
execute it simply in Prolog. And then
you would get suitable answers, how

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:07,570
A, B, C could look like, so that they are
each throws of the W6 and the sum is 15.

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:17,710
To the identification again: The Generate part would be
here The + that. That's where the search space is spanned.

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:27,490
The simple operation here is just: A + B + C should add up
to 15. Let's make the example a little more interesting:

121 # slide
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:37,450
Let's imagine that I would like to know for which
possibilities it is, that we had different numbers of

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,480
dice, had different numbers of eyes
and a total of 15 came out again.

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,270
If we call this, we will also get combinations of
A, B, C, where A and B are the same, for example

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,350
or where all three are simply 5. A = 5,
B = 5, C = 5 would be a solution here.

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,890
Suppose my problem is actually different. I
don't want to have repeated numbers of eyes.

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,900
I wonder, if I roll the dice three times and three times,
something different has come out, under which conditions

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:14,620
then 15 can still have come out. How can I
implement this? I'll just have to think about either

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:28,060
extending my generator or my tester. You
could say, instead of just generating all

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:37,120
three choices, so to speak A, B, C from the space 1 to
6 and all combinations thereof, I would like to have

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,410
only those combinations where A, B, C are different, where
A, B, C are different. One possibility would be simply

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:52,870
to say: You do the same as before, but add something
here. So, again [1,2,3,4,5,6] as the dice numbers.

00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:00,880
A, B, C are supposed to come from this range. And it is still checked
that A is not equal to B, A is not equal to C and B is not equal to C.

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:08,460
They must be different in pairs. This can
be achieved or expressed this \= here.

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:18,000
Then this would be altogether the description of
the search space. More complicated description,

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
however, leads to a smaller search space. And
under those, this condition is checked again.

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,320
Now, of course, a real subset of the
results of this query will come out,

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:44,910
because additional restrictions to the
elements of the search space have been made.

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,530
Or you can actually express this in a more clever and
shorter way, if one uses suitable existing predicates.

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:57,420
What does it mean that I have three
different elements from this list?

00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:05,280
If I have three different elements from this list,
then these are three elements of a permutation.

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,570
Because with permutations no element of the
original list is used twice. So, one possibility

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:20,820
would be to say, I consider permutations of
[1,2,3,4,5,6]. From the permutation, I take

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:30,390
the first three elements. I don't care about the other three.
And that is my search space. That is more succinctly expressed.

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:38,160
Perhaps also expressed more declaratively. And simply
gives a shorter way to describe this search space.

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,070
The condition again is the same as above. So to
speak, I have only simplified the generative part here

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:53,280
or made it fancier. Semantically, from the meaning it
is exactly the same. Note also these underscores here.

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,070
Of course, I can't write, [A,B,C] is a permutation
of [1,2,3,4,5,6]. That would give no solution at all.

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:05,340
Because the permutation must contain six elements again.
But I can say, from the permutations, I am interested

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:11,070
only in the first three elements. That means I use
anonymous variables here. This simply stands for:

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:16,670
"I don't care about the rest of the variables. I don't know
or need them." And if you would try this again, you will find,

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:28,430
that you can actually solve this problem with
that, too. One last variation on this example.

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,050
Let's imagine that this is supposed to be even more interesting
or more complicated. Namely, we are now concerned with

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:41,390
to consider or get all possibilities, so
that if we roll the dice three times without

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:49,310
repeating a number of dice and we are lucky or we
have the situation that the numbers of the dice

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:56,000
have occurred in ascending order. So, it can
no longer be that we first 6, then 5, then 4

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,510
rolled the dice. Although these are three
rolls that are different and add up to 15.

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:12,680
But we only consider cases where, for example, 4,
5, 6 have been rolled. Can we express that as well?

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,360
Somehow we have to make even stronger statements about A, B, C
than just that they are different. What we either here or here

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,740
by using the permutation. What could we
do? We could use our isSorted predicate,

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,810
which we defined earlier in the other problem. That's
always nice if we can use existing predicates after.

122 # slide
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:39,680
So, it's about this addition now: We should only consider constellations
that should be considered, where the different numbers of eyes

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,110
were in ascending order. And in total,
they should still add up to 15.

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,340
A solution could be that we take one of these two solutions.
For example, the second one, because it is short by itself.

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:56,210
And simply still require that [A,B,C]
is actually an ascending sequence.

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:03,680
So, we could say, we're looking at permutations for [1,2,3,4,5,6].
Of these permutations, look at the first three elements.

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,740
We don't care about the others, because we just
need three numbers of eyes. And we also require

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,500
that A, B, C are in ascending order. So, we use
our isSorted predicate that we used earlier for the

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,570
permutation sorting. And as before,
of course, we want A + B + C = 15.

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:29,630
Now, again, we could think about how to interpret
that. Now we have three predicates here, three demands.

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:36,170
Which of them is Generate and which of them is
Test? There is at least in this example actually

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,540
room for interpretation. You could say these two things
together, the permutation call and the isSorted call together,

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:49,410
describe the search space, because our candidates
exactly three different numbers of eyes

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:56,310
in ascending order. That would be our
search space. And test would be only,

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:04,350
that the sum of these three candidate values
is 15. Or we could say, taking the perspective,

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:12,600
that this is the generation part. So, our
search space includes as in the example before

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,650
simply includes all three dice with
different results and the requirement,

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:26,700
that they be sorted in ascending order,
we interpret that as part of the test.

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:36,090
So, the evaluation of the candidates. This does
not change the correctness of this solution.

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,580
Generate and Test is a principle how to approach certain
problems. This still leaves us freedom to formulate

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:52,750
what our generator is and what our test
is. Below we will see some examples.

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,900
Not more this video, but for intermediary
summary, a brief look at when we will use the

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,840
are going to use. So, when is such a generate-and-test
approach useful? It can't solve every problem.

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,500
It's easy to think about that. Even
sorting by permuting is not very efficient.

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:18,430
If you have long lists, there are simply very many
permutations and you would have to create all permutations

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:24,160
and test each one for sortedness. That doesn't
mean that Prolog does it the same way.

00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:31,900
Prolog has an efficient implementation. So, it can
actually shorten certain parts of the search by a clever

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:39,520
implementation. But at least conceptually,
the search space can be very large.

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:47,560
And in permuting, this is usually the case if the lists are not
rather short. So, you have to do it with a sense of proportion.

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,960
In the lecture and in the exercises, of course, there
will be examples of where this actually makes sense.

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,570
A reasonable criterion is the set of
potential solutions, the candidates,

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:05,740
should at least be finite. So, there must not be infinite many
solutions. Then one does not come with the tests to the conclusion.

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:14,350
It is even better if the search space is as small as
possible. This is of course a question of interpretation:

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,960
When is small enough? In the examples that we
have seen here, this was not a problem. So, for a

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:29,440
search space with six elements, the number of permutations
is still manageable. That would be an indication

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,070
that one can work with Generate and Test. Of course,
it is also possible that the problem is larger

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:41,770
or there is a larger search space and you
still want to work with Generate-and-Test. Why?

00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,240
Perhaps because one simply has no other idea. Either
because you don't know any algorithmic principles

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,970
or the problem is actually very
difficult to grasp systematically.

00:27:51,970 --> 00:28:00,720
There it can be that one falls back on Generate and
Test because at least the effort of writing the program

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,900
is relatively low. Even if perhaps
the execution then takes longer.

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:15,510
So, then it can also be that the problem is
not an obvious way to somehow find a systematic

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:23,150
solution, it can be worthwhile to
try it with Generate and Test.

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,100
And of course, as you [as Komedia students] have not
yet attended an algorithms lecture and no dedicated

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:33,840
programming lecture, Generate and Test can simply be Generate
and Test can easily be used at least in the practice mode

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,560
but also in other applications, may be a good
well feasible way. Of course, this second

00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,420
criterion is a bit of a cop-out. If I don't know
anything else, then I just do Generate-and-Test.

00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:52,410
That's one way of looking at it, of course. However,
Prolog is actually very well suited to write

00:28:52,410 --> 00:29:00,000
down such solutions. And that can certainly be a
first approach, that one comes quickly to a program.

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Of course, these were still very artificial examples. Let's have
a look at two more interesting examples in two further videos.
