00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,730
As a more complex example of Generate-and-Test I
would like to return to this so-called Einstein

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,780
puzzle. I had already mentioned this
in the introduction/motivation of the

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,039
course ["Introduction to Logic" for Komedia] and I had also claimed
at the beginning of the Prolog part that it could be solved

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,050
this could be solved well with Prolog. Reminder:
That was the situation that somehow was said:

00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,829
"Five Houses. Each of a different color and
inhabited by a man of a different nationality.

00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,399
Different pet, drink and brand of smokes."
So, there are these different characteristics

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,170
that the houses have. Who lives in them.
Where they're located. What colors they have.

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,760
And then properties of who lives in the house.
And there are a number of clues given in natural

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,500
language, which we can of course somehow
then convert to logic or, in our case now

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,339
Prolog would have to convert. Then
through these clues, so to speak,

00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:07,000
the situation is described and at the end there is the
question from the riddle, who is the owner of the zebra

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,360
and who is the water drinker. So,
certain characteristics from these clues.

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,820
In that case: who owns the zebra and who drinks water.
There could be other things asked as well. The point is,

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,680
you have to draw enough information from the clues
to be able to answer such specific questions.

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,690
And we'd like to solve that using generate-and-test.
That is, we already know that we should probably

129 # slide
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:39,790
first of all think about how we
can implement the generate part.

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,780
This is actually a little bit different than in the
examples before. There we had always used either

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,619
member or permutation because, for example,
we just wanted to draw the cube numbers from

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:58,100
a fixed pool. Or had certain digits and
were looking for combinations of how

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,189
to map them to individual letters, or to
map the letters to the numbers. Then the

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:08,869
permutation was a relevant tool. Here it is now
a bit different. Here it is not such an area,

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,099
to which one draws something, but it is simply a matter of the
fact that these different constellations that the houses could

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,610
have is the search space. Then we could first of
all approach it in a very abstract way and say:

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:28,370
Our Generate part is simply the expression
that there are five houses. So, we want to

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,980
put the houses in a list, so to speak. We know
at the beginning that it's a five-element list,

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,120
because there are five houses. But we say at the search space first
of all: "This is quite general. There are only these five houses.

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,239
We don't know anything about their properties
yet." That is, the entire search space would be

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,379
simply all the possible expressions that exist
here. That's where we can again use this _

00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,849
as an anonymous variable. So, information
that still has to be assigned of course,

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:58,620
but is completely free at the beginning. So, the search space would
be correspondingly large. We could also be a bit more specific.

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,290
We will have to store five properties
for each house, according to what the

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:12,299
puzzle gives as attributes for the houses. So,
their color, nationality of the inhabitant, etc.

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,560
Then we can make it a bit
more specific/refined and say:

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,840
We have these five houses. Each of these five
houses has five characteristics, but they are

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,849
all set empty, so to speak, at the beginning.
We could say: The search space is simply

00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:35,370
all houses or all house lists of the form that
we have five houses. Each house has these five

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:42,019
properties, but they are all unknown at the beginning.
Of course, this corresponds (relatively well even) to,

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,689
what we did with our manual solution. There
we had started to fill such a matrix.

00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:57,700
I remind you of it once again. It looked
like this. This is how we started,

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,120
the manual solution. So, we set up this
matrix. There were also these five houses.

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,379
Then five properties each. So,
somehow 25 positions to fill.

00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:13,760
At the beginning, there was nothing in it. This corresponds
now to these _ that we have everything still empty.

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,510
Somewhat we must pay attention that in the Prolog list
representation, (due to the fact, how these lists are written down)

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,190
the matrix is to be read exactly transposed, so to speak. So, here
it says: 1st house, 2nd house, 3rd house, 4th house, 5th house.

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,570
And here would be the five characteristics
in the columns, while just here, so to speak

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:39,880
the columns were the houses
and in the rows the properties

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,170
per house were indicated. Apart from that,
this corresponds very well to that idea:

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,110
You simply have as a search space this
table, which you have to fill somehow.

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:59,040
And the test part then hopefully makes sure
that we or Prolog can solve the problem.

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:10,280
How do we then go through for the test
part? We just look at the individual clues.

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,700
We have this list of clues. These are of
course expressed linguistically/verbally.

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,280
We look at each one of them and figure out,
how we can express that as a Prolog test.

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,641
Of course, about this search space. So, related to such
a list of houses. For example, the first clue says:

00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:34,460
"The Englishman lives in the red house." Then we
still have to determine how we want to interpret

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,750
the positions. So, which position corresponds
to which property? There we would,

130 # slide
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:47,320
for example, decide on the order:
"color, nationality, drink, pet, smoke".

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:59,240
That was the order in which the
matrix was also manually, so to speak.

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,520
This sequence "color, nationality, drink, pet, smoke".
That's what I'm going for now when I interpret these lists.

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,470
Then the hint that the Englishman lives in the
red house would simply be the statement that

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,780
there must be one among the houses which has
the color red and accommodates the Englishman.

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:23,630
Which house that is, we don't know yet.
It could be any one of these five houses.

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,930
We also don't know anything about the other attributes,
that are present in this house. We just want to at least

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,620
exactly express what this clue says. Namely,
"The Englishman lives in the red house."

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,370
That is, there must be a house where the color is red and the
inhabitant is English. The other things don't matter for now,

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,300
because they are not determined by this
clue. That means this still provides

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,770
many possibilities, but restricts the search
space somewhat. Namely, in the sense that no

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,400
constellations are conceivable where this occupancy
does not exist in one of the houses. No matter what the

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,740
other three positions, i.e. to the drink,
to the pet, and to the cigarette brand.

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,380
They are not relevant for this first clue.
That's why we don't assign them here in any way.

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,880
So, we use this member predicate for this, although
this is now in the test part. Before, in the other

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,190
examples, we often used member in the
generate part. I had just talked about that.

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,150
Now, here it would actually be in the test part.
By means of the member predicate, we express

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:31,140
that one of the houses has certain
properties. That was the first clue.

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:40,770
We kind of had 14 clues. So, we
have to do that for each clue now.

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,760
We just do it in order. We don't have to think about it too much, as
with the manual solution, whether we first take the seventh or the

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,320
tenth clue. We are not yet describing any search
at all. We are only describing what we want.

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,480
If you think back to the video before last:
What? vs. How? with the permutation sorting.

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,320
We're just describing what we want now. We do not have to
yet specify a strategy for how we will find the solution.

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,720
Therefore, the order in which we treat these clues
does not matter. If we look for a solution concretely

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,150
by hand, we may have to do it in a certain order. But
here, where we only describe what we actually want,

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,920
we can just do it one by one. So, we can take the second
clue. The one that said, "The Spaniard owns a dog."

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:26,000
We can describe that again quite analogously to this clue. Among
the houses, there must be one that accommodates the Spaniard

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,090
and where a dog lives. And of course, we
already know that then obviously this cannot be

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,970
the same house. But that is not our
task currently, to somehow express

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:43,840
or to take it into account. We simply
translate the individual clues. They limit

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:53,770
what Prolog has in terms of possible solutions.
But that's not our task or goal here,

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,340
to connect these clues, to think about
what follows from them. That is the logical

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,900
part, which Prolog may do afterwards,
finding the solution. We simply express the

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:11,280
individual clues. Then this is quite analogous
to this first hint and refers of course again

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:20,170
to the completely unrestricted house list
from the slide before. The next hints

131 # slide
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,690
can also be treated analogously. The third and
fourth hints are also hints in the form that somehow

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:31,130
exactly two properties of houses are set. So, it
is said that there are houses which have exactly

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,890
two properties at the same time. For example,
that coffee is drunk in the green house,

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,320
just means: There is a house which is green
and coffee is drunk there. The same applies

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,360
for the fourth clue. So, you can simply translate
them analogously to the first and second clues.

132 # slide
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:56,970
So, there we can apply our strategy for expressing here
several times. After that, it gets a little more interesting.

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,320
Because there is the fifth hint, and it says something
where you can't just take the member predicate directly.

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,630
Because here it says: "The green house is
directly to the right of the ivory house."

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,940
This is not, after all, a property that refers
only to one house, like coffee in the green house.

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,520
But here, somehow, two houses are in relation to
each other. In this case, in terms of their color.

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,750
So, member is not enough here. Member would only be able to say something
about a about one house. We have to say something about two houses.

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,270
And that is in the list of all houses. How
could we express that? We could, if we had

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,820
a predicate, what this "rightOf" this
right of something could/would express,

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:42,270
then we could write the following: We could
say there must be a house. Its properties

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,900
except for the color do not matter to us. But it
is the green house. And there is the ivory house,

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,010
whose other properties are also indifferent
to us for this reference. We want to express

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,180
that exactly this one house is to the right of the other one
in the list of houses. We can refer this only to a concrete

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:04,670
list. Green house next to the ivory house
in our list of houses, which is finally our

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:11,250
candidate for the solution of the puzzle. Such a "rightOf"
predicate does not exist in such a predefined way.

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,700
But we know how to define list predicates
ourselves. It is simply a matter of

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,020
expressing in a list (in this case a
list of houses) that two certain elements

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,360
occur in the same way, that one is to the
right of the other. So, we simply define this.

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,530
We need such a predicate. This does not
exist yet. We can define it. And in a simple

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,840
way, with means that we have already seen, which we have
also practiced. Remember: There was an example in the

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,720
example where we had to grab or describe the first
or fifth element of a list or to describe it.

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,780
We had been able to use append for that.
So, you can also express this "right of".

00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:57,130
You can say "right of left for two
concrete elements means there is a place

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,400
in the overall list where exactly the two are
in the order." There one could say, for example,

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,550
grab a prefix from the list, that should go
exactly up to and including these two elements

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,650
should go. Accessing a prefix simply means,
there must be a "nevermind" / unknown list,

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,710
so that prefix and this remainder
gives the original total list.

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,620
In this prefix, we would like the [L, R]
in exactly this order at the very end.

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,220
Because if they are at the end of a prefix of the
list, then that means they are somewhere in the list.

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,810
That they are at the end of the prefix in that order, you could
say: there must be an uninteresting list (it could be empty).

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,100
(which could also be empty).
But there must be some list.

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,090
It doesn't have to be the same as that. Anonymous always means something,
completely independent of other occurrences of the anonymous variable.

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,550
Namely, there should be some list, so that
if we add exactly the list [L, R] to it,

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,770
we get exactly this prefix, which in
turn, if we append something else to it,

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:05,410
would result in the total list. This expresses in a very
declarative way that somewhere in the complete list, List,

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,790
L and an R occur in that order. So, in other
words, that R occurs to the right of L in the list.

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:18,930
And then we can use this
for this clue five.

133 # slide
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:25,320
What do the next clues look like? Six and
seven are again very simple. These are again

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,210
clues that we can implement directly with the member.
Directly with member. I'm not going to give that again here.

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,290
But there is a slide at the end where all
the hints are translated on it. But here

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:44,839
six and seven would simply be analogous to 1,
2, 3, 4. After that, it gets even more exciting.

00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,110
Because eighth and ninth clues look like this:
Again, they only say something about a house.

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,860
But about the position. So, not somehow "coffee in
the green house", but "milk in the middle house".

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,020
What is the middle house here is not
expressed by an attribute in this

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,690
list of five, where the color, nationality, etc.,
are written. That is, that is rather again a

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,060
structural property, which refers
to the house list as a whole.

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,220
The same is true for clue nine. That one also says
something, not about the drink, but about the nationality.

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,120
But also says: "in the leftmost house".
How could we implement these clues?

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:31,820
Basically, we reach a little bit
into the Generate part or over.

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,290
An encroachment, so to speak, on the Generate part. We
can simply say, instead of starting at the beginning,

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:42,220
start with, "Houses are...", and then it said just
never mind, never mind, never mind." Can we refine that

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,170
by saying: The list of houses is a list of five
things, each of which can be lists. And by the way,

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,170
on the first house, it doesn't really matter which
form it has, but the nationality entry in there

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:02,930
has to be Norwegian. Before it said
total for this first list simply _.

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,150
Or five underscores in a list. Now I say,
in the second position may be the Norwegian.

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,560
This is then the ninth clue, which just says: The
leftmost house, that is the first house of this list is

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,810
where the Norwegian lives. And that milk is drunk in the middle
house, I express by the fact that from this list of houses

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,270
at the third position (This is the first position.
This underscore is the second position.) and at the

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,040
third position is a house that has five attributes, of
which the middle one, namely the beverage attribute,

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:39,790
is milk. The fourth and fifth houses again don't matter. For
nothing is said about them in the eighth and ninth clues.

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,940
We would have, analogously or alternatively, the eighth and ninth
clues, instead of intervening in this house representation, also

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:53,910
expressed, for example, with a first- and third-predicate.
So, simply saying, in the test part it is true,

00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,790
that a list of this form is the first element of the list
of houses. We also had this first-predicate in the exercise.

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:07,600
That could have been used here as well, instead
of refining this, so to speak. One would have here

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,110
several possibilities. I have chosen this one now
because it is very illustrative how I can express it.

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:18,850
Even if I intervene a bit in the Generate part, so to speak.
In the end, this is just an idea of the Generate-and-Test.

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,660
You can play around with it a bit and not have to
adhere strictly to the rule that the eighth and ninth

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:32,430
that in no case the eighth and ninth clue should be directly
expressed be expressed directly in this list of houses.

134 # slide
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:41,080
Now we have the ninth clue. What happens next? The
next clue is this: "The man who smokes Chesterfield,

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:55,029
lives in the house next to the one with the fox."
This is a bit like the rightOf - "right of".

00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:01,029
However, it just says, "next to". So,
that could be either left or right.

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:07,130
So, we can't use our rightOf directly, because it
doesn't say anything about "next to", but right of.

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:15,660
So, we need another auxiliary predicate. We would like
to say something like: "The house where Chesterfield

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:24,920
is smoked is next to the house where the fox
lives." Within this list of houses, but just

00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,309
not "rightOf", but "nextTo". So, we have to
define a predicate for it. That does not

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:35,060
exist yet either. But it is not difficult to define, because
"nextTo" simply means: Either the one house is to the

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,620
right of the other or vice versa. We can express
this very simply. We have defined "rightOf".

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,040
When is an element to the right of another element in a list?
That two elements are simply next to each other is called:

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:56,920
either X is to the right of Y or Y is to the right
of X. In both cases, and exactly in these two cases,

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:07,670
X is next to Y in the list. This
allows us to express clue ten.

135 # slide
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,470
Then come four clues, all of which can now be
expressed analogously to those already seen.

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,230
So, either and use of "nextTo" or of "member".
So, the eleventh hint is again one with nextTo.

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:26,530
So, we would proceed in the same way as with the
tenth hint. The 12th and 13th hints are again

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:33,190
simply hints that link two attributes of a house
together. So, the cigarette brand and the drink.

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,120
Or the nationality and the cigarette brand.
They are again expressed with such member lines,

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:47,610
like hint 1, hint 2, etc. Note
14 is again a "nextTo" note.

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:54,570
So, it would again be expressed like the tenth hint
can be expressed. And then we would actually have

00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:02,500
expressed all 14 clues. Are we done? Almost.
We still have to say what we actually want.

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,090
We still have to ask our question. Ultimately the
task was to find out the owner of the zebra and the

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,110
zebra owner and the water drinker,
when we have processed all the clues.

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,250
How else can we express this, so to speak?
We simply use variables for the zebra owner

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:27,300
and the water drinker. And write demand/ clues/
Expressions there, which ultimately then tell us:

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:34,180
"The zebra owner as a variable is actually someone
who lives in a house where the zebra also lives."

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:40,710
Analogous for the water drinker.
So, we just use variables

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,620
for these two unknowns, according to which we
want to solve for, and further member calls,

00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,670
which expresses that the zebra owner is exactly the
person who lives in the house where the zebra lives.

136 # slide
00:19:52,670 --> 00:20:02,610
Then we can write it down altogether like this. Here
are the auxiliary predicates "rightOf" and "nextTo".

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,030
Here's the predicate that we're going
to call. So, "solve", we want to solve.

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,950
We want to find out the zebra owner and the
water drinker. Here are the clues processed,

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:20,450
as it was just talked through in the past slides. So, here,
for example, the eighth and ninth clues in this house spelling.

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,200
Then each of the clues with member, rightOf
or nextTo expressed. So, up to here is that,

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,160
What we discussed in the previous slides.
And then the two queries for the zebra owner

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,460
and the water drinker we can express, by
saying, for the variables, for these unknowns.

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:41,260
must hold, for example: Among the houses there
must be one where the zebra lives as a pet.

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,260
And the nationality of the inhabitant of this house, we
would like to get back as ZebraOwner in the variable.

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:54,920
And analogously for the water drinker.
Now we can actually enter the program,

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:03,390
ask Prolog the query solve(ZebraOwner,
WaterDrinker), and would get as an answer:

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:10,220
ZebraOwner is Japanese. Japanese would
come as the assignment for ZebraOwner.

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:17,820
And for the WaterDrinker we would have to get the Norwegian.
This is the solution we had also determined by hand.

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:30,380
At the beginning of the discussion in the
first or second lecture. Then we would have

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:38,980
solved our puzzle the Prolog way. Is
this now better than the manual search?

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,310
It's certainly a matter of perspective. Maybe
it is more fun to solve such a puzzle by hand.

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:48,620
But this is just a solution that can be transferred.
A solution that allows us to simply concentrate

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,400
to concentrate on the "what? Namely, on the implementation
of these clues and not to somehow pursue special

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,860
search strategies. We leave that to
the Prolog system. We did not have to

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,950
order or think about any order,
in which we work with the clues,

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,590
because that's not our problem, it's Prolog's problem. And
we could (this is perhaps almost the most important point)

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:17,870
adjust that very easily. So, if
we solve the problem by hand,

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:23,640
as we did at the beginning in the lecture,
then we had to work with the hints.

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,620
Sometimes also had to revise things. Let's assume that
we had made a mistake somewhere in the process or that

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,120
we would realize while working with the puzzle, that we had
misinterpreted a clue, that it was actually meant in a different

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,990
that it was meant differently, then it would probably mean here with this
manual solution it would probably mean that we would have to start from scratch.

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,530
If we have used a hint somewhere in
between, but it was meant differently

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,850
or the puzzle changes and someone
might want to solve a different puzzle,

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,320
then we cannot reuse much of what we do here by hand.
we can't reuse much of what we do by hand. In the

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,970
worst case, we would have to solve the puzzle completely from scratch,
because we perhaps indirectly used something somewhere that is no longer true.

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,059
Of course, we also come to a solution for a concrete constellation.
If we interpret everything correctly, we also come to the

00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:11,130
same solution with the Norwegian, who drinks
water and the Japanese, who owns the zebra.

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:17,790
But we are just, so to speak, fixed on it, to
do it with the exact clues and can't adapt it

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,920
not be able to adapt it if we want to
solve a slightly different problem.

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,820
On the other hand, in our Prolog solution we can
edit each hint individually and then just let

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:35,500
Prolog reprocess that. So, if we change one of
the clues, then we just need to change the clue

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,250
appropriately and then we can again let Prolog
do all the work of finding the solution.

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:49,000
And that will do that, of course, in this generate-and-test
principle, because that's the way we put it.
