00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,800
The next ingredient for our consideration of the
operational semantics of Prolog is resolution.

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,280
And again, this is a concept from the study of
predicate logic, so a general formal concept.

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,520
And again, here, we will not consider it
exactly in the form as you have seen it

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,960
in the lecture by Professor König; instead
it will be tailored to the use in Prolog.

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,920
So the notation will be slightly
different, more specialized actually

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,280
for the syntax that we have in Prolog
and the way the queries are organized.

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,040
But the general concept behind it is exactly
what resolution is also in predicate logic.

73 # slide
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,800
We will again first consider a simple case,
namely without variables, and then consider

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,360
the actually important and slightly more
complicated case of general queries and rules.

00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,400
Okay, so let's start with the simple
case that we don't have variables.

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,960
So our query that we want to deal
with would be something like this.

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,000
So basically, a list of variable-free literals.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,480
So these would be simplifications of atoms,

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:32,160
predicate names to constants or nestings of data
constructors and constants, but no variables.

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,480
Okay?

00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,360
And the notation here is meant to mean that
P and Q could be sequences of such literals.

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,120
And L is one specific literal.

00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,920
Of course, P and/or Q could also be empty;
then the query would be just one literal.

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
But in general, maybe we have three literals
here; then we have one literal L that we

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,160
are currently interested in or that you
will deal with in this resolution step.

00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,680
And then we may have, I don't
know, two further literals in Q.

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,760
Okay, and then the resolution
proof principle that allows us to

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,560
prove such a query, such a statement.

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
Yes, we want to know whether P or
the queries or the literals in P

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
and L and all literals in Q are true, right?

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,080
The comma corresponds to "and", as we know.

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
And we want to prove this, or at least you want to
make one step in such a proof. So that would not

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,880
be a proof of the whole statement at once, but
we want to make progress in proving this part L.

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,720
Okay, what do we need to have for this?

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,680
We need to have a rule, which somehow implies L.

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,560
Yeah, that would be a rule, a program rule where
either L is simply a fact or L is implied by

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
some other literals.

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Okay?

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,640
A program clause which has L as its
head, or which is simply L as a fact.

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
And for the moment, also, these would all
be considered to be without variables.

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,960
So also L occurring in the head of a clause

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,120
would be without variables, which is
of course not very generally the case.

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Okay, so how can we make progress?

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,080
Well, what if you have a rule which
said that L is implied by L1, …, Ln.

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Yes, so n could be even zero; then this would
be a fact because there wouldn't be a right-hand

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,440
side, or if n is one or two or three, then L is
implied by the conjunction of some other literals.

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,040
Or L is implied by just L1 if n = 1.

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,480
Okay, so we want to prove P and L and Q.

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,160
We know that L is implied by L1 to Ln,

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,080
so of course we could also say, well, let's
prove P and L1 and L2, et cetera, and Q.

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,240
It will be clear and very intuitive
that if we want to prove P and L and Q,

00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,840
and we know that L is implied by
the conjunction of these things,

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,840
then it's also okay and useful
to prove this conjunction.

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,120
Okay?

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,840
Of course, this looks now like we
haven't really made progress in

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
the proof because this is now bigger in general.

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,920
But that both depends on n and also on
what the L1 to Ln actually are, right?

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,960
So maybe these are simpler
statements than the L statements.

00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Then it's a good idea to reduce this.

00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,800
Or if n equals zero, then actually
this will have become smaller because

00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,720
then the sequence is actually the empty sequence.

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,280
Then really L has been eliminated since we
had a fact. That holds if n equals zero.

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,440
Okay, but this is a very intuitive proof step.

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,280
We just want to prove this conjunction. We
know that L is implied by this right-hand side,

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,240
then we might as well prove this new query.

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,960
And if we succeeded in doing that,
then we have also proved this.

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
So that's a reduction from this
proof goal to this proof goal.

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,480
Okay?

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,760
So some observations on this.

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,520
The one is that, of course,
the L was chosen arbitrarily.

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,960
Well, it was chosen because I wanted to
resolve with this specific program clause.

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,520
But of course, given a sequence with more than
one literal, I could have chosen any of them.

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,440
So I could have… if indeed I have three literals
in P and L and Q, then I didn’t have to choose the

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,160
fourth literal from this list of literals; I
could also have taken the first one, for example.

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,080
And even after I have committed to one L, so let's
say the fourth of six literals in a query here,

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,800
then I could still have a choice
between several program clauses.

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
So maybe there is in the program
another rule also with L as the head

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,240
and some other L1’, L2’,
et cetera, up to some Ln’.

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Then I could have chosen either of these rules.

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,040
I would have arrived at different
next queries to process.

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,600
So there is a search involved
here; there is a choice to make,

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,200
but actually this step here as
written here simply assumes, well,

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,640
I have chosen one L; I have chosen one
clause; then what is the resolved query?

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,440
This control is actually making a choice
for the literal and making a choice

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,920
between possibly different program
clauses; that's a separate process.

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,160
One resolution step is just one such
step with the choice already made.

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,560
Okay?

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
This is one thing to keep in mind when
we consider derivation trees later.

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
And the other thing is something
I’ve already mentioned.

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,720
Well, this need not always become bigger as the
slides suggest at the moment. Actually, since

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
n could be zero.

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,280
It can also be the case that this really
becomes smaller because then it vanishes.

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
That's how we ultimately make progress
and can finish a proof that a

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,200
few times we apply rules, we apply facts, which
don't have a right-hand side, and stuff vanishes.

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,040
But it might be that first
we have to introduce more

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,720
subliterals and only at some point later on
things vanish and we arrive at a fact, right?

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
Because if you have removed every
literal by a sequence of such

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,840
steps, then you have an empty
conjunction which is simply true.

74 # slide
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,400
Okay, that was a discussion
of the very simple case.

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,640
If you don't have variables. And
of course, it's very restricted.

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,080
Yes, we couldn't have
variables in the query, okay?

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,920
That's something we are used to from Haskell that

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,640
we have to have concrete values
in the thing you want to compute.

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,880
But you also couldn't have
any variables in the program.

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Yes, actually the program rules would have

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,120
had to have heads exactly like the L from
the query in order to make any progress.

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
So, they must be very specific.

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,000
No pattern-matching, where the program
rules could contain variables and then,

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,640
they are matched against concrete terms.

00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,600
So, anything like that.

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
Okay, that's very restricted.

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
So, let's look at the general case.

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,080
So, now with variables, yes.

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,880
So, we still take a decomposition like this.

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,280
So, we assume we have a sequence of literals and
we focus on one of them, let's call it L and

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:26,080
maybe there are sequences before and after it, it
could also be empty, then we would have only the L.

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,560
Okay.

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,440
And what do we want to do?

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,200
Well, we want to, again, reduce
this to some other query.

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,440
And preferably, we want to use a rule,
which tells us something about L.

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,400
But we don't want to look in the program
for a rule which has exactly L as its head.

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,680
Because that would be too
restricted, then we couldn't prove

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,840
general things with general programs.

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,400
Okay, that's why we get something slightly
different than on the slide before.

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,200
So, we won't have P and L1 to Ln where L
is implied by L1 to Ln and then also Q.

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,960
But there is a substitution applied.
A unifier has to be applied.

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay, now where does this unifier come
from and how is now the rule selected?

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,280
Because we won't, take a rule
which has exactly L as its head.

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Instead, we look for something
which is similar to L. And similar

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,040
of course means in the sense of pattern
matching or more general unification.

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay, so we don't look for a program
clause which has exactly L as its head.

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,680
You look for a program clause
which has some L0 in its head,

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
which is similar to L, which is unifiable.

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,600
Okay?

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,320
So, the program clause will be
something like: L0 implied by L1 to Ln.

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,640
And L1 to Ln are the things
to which we reduced here.

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
Again, we replace L by the conjunction

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,120
L1 to Ln because the rule, which
is from L1 to Ln for n >= 0,

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,160
it could also be a fact for n = 0,

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,360
for n > 0 it's a real rule,

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,720
and these L1 to Ln do imply L0, which
should be unifiable with L, okay?

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,320
And since you have variables now, both
in the program clauses and in the query,

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,360
this one, but also then the resolved query
of course, we have to be a bit careful.

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,440
And as a rule of thumb, you could simply
always rename the variables in the program.

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
Yes, if you have a program where
P (X) is implied by Q (X),

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,520
you might as well write P
(Y) is implied by Q (Y).

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,240
If you consistently rename variables by renaming

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,000
the variable names or indexing them with
numbers, then we can't make any mistakes.

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,680
And the aim is basically to make sure that
there is no dangerous overlap between variables

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
in the program clause that we are
going to use and in the query.

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,760
So, no overlap, not just between L and this
program clause, but also the neighboring

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
literals in the query.

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,680
Yes, to the left or to the right, all
of them should have no variable names

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,840
in common with the program
clause we are going to use.

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,680
Yes, it might not always be a problem to
have overlap, but it can lead to problems.

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
So, we might as well avoid it.

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,720
Okay, and now what's the connection?

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,760
Well, the connection is there must
be a unifier between L and L0.

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,240
And of course, as mentioned earlier, we are
always looking for the most general unifier.

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,600
If you don't just want to have any
way to make L and L0 match or equal,

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
we want to have to do this
in the most general way.

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,280
So, not committing to too specific
instantiations for the variables in L or in L0.

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Okay, and the idea here is if you want to
prove P and L and Q, and we have a rule

00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,080
saying that L0 is implied by a
conjunction of some other things,

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,040
and L and L0 are similar enough that they can
be unified, then you might as well say, well,

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,760
let's consider this unifier
which makes them equal.

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:14,240
Then U(L0), (U applied to L0) would
be implied by U(L1) and U(L2), etc.

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,360
Okay?
But U(L0) is of course not L, but U(L)

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,800
is U(L0), if it's a most general
unifier, or even just a unifier.

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,440
Okay, so you could replace
U(L) by U(L1) to U(Ln).

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,920
Yes, because then we would have
simply applied a unifier to

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,480
this rule as a whole, simply renaming
or instantiating variables consistently.

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,600
Okay.

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,520
Then we can replace U(L) by U(L1) to U(Ln).

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,840
But of course, we can't simply do this
without considering the context, because

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,840
when we apply the unifier to this literal
L, we might instantiate some variables.

00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,680
But, of course, these variables
might as well appear in P and Q.

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
That's something that's allowed in

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,320
these kinds of queries that the
variables occur in several literals.

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,640
So, if X is in L, we can't simply
say the unifier replaces X with zero

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,120
in L, but we leave the X
occurrences of P and Q unchanged.

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,080
That wouldn't be a valid
way to delete this query.

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,320
Okay?

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
So, if you decide, well, in
order to make L and L0 unified

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,800
to make them equal, we replace
X with zero, say in L.

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,600
Then we can only do this if
we also do so in P and Q.

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,400
If we make a choice to
instantiate X to zero, then

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,640
we have applied U to P and L and Q, and
that's not the query we're dealing with.

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,560
And then we know U(L) is the same
as U(L0) because of this unifier.

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
Then we know that U(L0) is implied by U(L1) to

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:59,600
U(Ln), and then you might as well replace U(L)
with this sequence of substituted literals.

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,200
Okay?

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,520
And of course, to the left and
to the right, we still have

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,520
the unifier U applied to all literals
in P and all the literals in Q.

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,160
And then this is our new subquery.

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
Our new subquery for the proof.

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,120
And then we again proceed doing
this again and again, and then

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,360
hopefully we have replaced the whole
conjunction with the empty conjunction

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,840
and we are done because then we
have “true” as our current goal.
