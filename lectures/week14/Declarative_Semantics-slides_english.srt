00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,720
For the last video in this week, we will talk
about the declarative semantics of Prolog.

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,560
So, semantics, what does the program mean?

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,440
And actually, we will be looking, overall, at
two different semantics (optional this year),

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,200
namely this declarative semantics
and then operational semantics.

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,440
So, the declarative semantics is really
more about the meaning of a program.

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
It could also be called the logical
semantics or the mathematical semantics.

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,160
And the operational semantics is
more about how execution works.

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
So, I have already given some intuition for this.

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
But when we talk about operational semantics,
it will be made more precise and more

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,240
concrete how a Prolog system can find a
solution for a query, given a certain program.

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,560
Okay, and that's a typical
distinction, to have different

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,160
kinds of semantics, more mathematically
leaning and more execution driven.

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
And of course, the execution-driven
semantics is what is used

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,320
for implementing a programming language.

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,800
And something like declarative
semantics is used for

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,560
reasoning about programs, for
example, if one wants to prove stuff.

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,320
So, for the Haskell part earlier in the course,
we talked a bit about operational behavior, right?

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,280
When we talked about pattern matching,
and how it drives evaluation.

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,760
So, lazy evaluation, which occurred previously

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,080
just as an idea, and then was
considered for a concrete program.

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
So, that is something like
operational semantics for Haskell.

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,040
We didn't even bother to give a
declarative semantics for Haskell.

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,160
So, that would be called
denotational semantics usually.

00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
And why didn't we do this?

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because for Haskell, really, there's such a close
fit to mathematics, to algebra, that writing down

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,480
such a semantics would have simply meant to
say that functions mean what functions mean.

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,840
So, we use the Haskell functions in the
same spirit as set theory functions.

00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
So, writing down definitions, and then

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we have written down a mapping, and that
is what the semantics is of that function.

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,760
There is a way to make this more precise.

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,000
But for the purposes of this course,
we simply blurred the semantic gap, the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
difference between syntax and
semantics in the Haskell case.

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
So, we write down a function
definition, and it means exactly

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,240
what this function definition
would mean mathematically.

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,600
Okay, so evaluating values by
using a definition as written down.

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,640
So, that's why for Haskell,
we didn't do this distinction.

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,800
But for Prolog here, we will provide
explanation of what the logical meaning is.

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,760
Okay, so this semantics here will be used
to answer questions about ground terms.

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
For terms without variables.

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,600
We will have rules with variables,
as we have seen in programs so far.

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,160
But the declarative semantics answers
questions about: is this predicate

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
true for the following terms which
themselves do not contain variables.

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,400
That's also distinct from operational semantics
where we will also deal with queries which

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
contain variables in that sense.

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,080
Also, the declarative semantics is a
bit simpler than the operational one.

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Because it doesn't have to cope
with variables in the queries.

40 # slide
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, so what is the mathematical, logical
meaning or semantics of a Prolog program?

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,840
And let's see a simple example Prolog
program that we have already considered.

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, the first and somewhat
obvious step would be to really

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,160
exchange the Prolog syntax for
normal syntax of predicate logic.

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,000
And actually, write down what the
rules or the fact and the rule that

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
we see here would mean or would be
written like in predicate logic.

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,960
And that's actually something that I've already
shown earlier, when we discussed rules of

00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:03,040
variables and talked about free variables, then I
used this transcription to normal logical syntax,

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,440
in particular this explicit
role of the quantifiers.

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:18,080
And then the idea was, well, basically, this
fact is turned into a statement about all x.

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,280
Where x is now used as a variable, and it's
all-quantified because this holds for all

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,400
choices for x and, well, a rule
like this alternative implication.

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
So, the right-hand side

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,040
implies the left-hand side and then of
course, you can also write it in that order.

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
And again, all the variables that
occur here are all quantified.

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,080
And then of course, since we have several
statements that have a rule, they are conjuncted.

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,800
So, they are combined with
logical-and that is then

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,920
what the logical formula would be that
corresponds to this Prolog program.

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, of course, this is just a
change of syntax, this doesn't,

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
by itself, explain what the
meaning of the program is.

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,720
Okay, but now that we are in the world of
formal logic we can use (and that's something

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,320
I've indicated early on), we can use the
methods and techniques from the study of logic.

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,920
And I explained before that I will
lean on background material provided

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,720
in the previous lecture by Professor
König and I pointed you to slides

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
that explain these concepts
or repeat these concepts,

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,680
where you can check your
understanding or refresh it.

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,040
Okay.

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,560
And then, how is meaning given to logic formulas
or to such combinations also of formulas?

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,840
Well, that's what logic starts
with in the form of models.

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,760
And if you go through the first few slides,
actually, from the excerpt that I uploaded

00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,320
to Moodle a while ago, from Professor König's
lecture, there is this concept of "Struktur".

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,640
So, that's our definition of given signature,
given constant and predicate names, etc.

00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,440
What this Struktur is, and that is basically
the setup for describing the model.

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
So, what is contained there?

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
Well, there must be some
set of mathematical objects.

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,760
These are the things on which the variables
are then later assumed to be quantified, right?

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,160
If you say "for all x", then you need to know,
well, what are the choices that we have for x?

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,960
And in a very general
structure in this logic study

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,760
of models, there could be just any set of
mathematical objects that will later be

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,800
constrained in Herbrand structures and models,
which also occurs in the slides of Professor König.

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,640
But from the outside, it would be
just some set of mathematical objects.

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,120
Okay.

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,720
And then everything is built on top of that.

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,680
So, in particular, the constants like in this
case, zero, and there could, of course, be further

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
constants occurring in the program, they need to
be interpreted as elements of that set, right?

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
So, this is just an arbitrary set.

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,600
And then, for example, the
zero must be in that set.

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,520
Must be interpreted in that set.

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:20,480
Okay, and likewise, functors or data constructors,
and like this s in this case here occurring in

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,440
the program that needs to be interpreted as
a function on these mathematical objects.

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
So, since this takes one argument,

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,080
you can already see this from the domain
over which the variables may quantify.

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,400
So, this then should be
interpreted as a function from

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,200
this set of mathematical
objects into that set again.

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,240
So, then it would be a binary predicate, a binary
symbol, then it would be a function from the

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,120
Cartesian product of this set of mathematical
objects of itself to that set again.

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,440
Okay, so that's how then the
data part is interpreted.

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
The constants as elements
of the set and the functors

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,400
(so, the data constructors) as functions
of appropriate arity over the set.

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,640
Okay, and then you also have
to deal with the predicates.

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,880
So, the things about which the facts
and rules make logical statements,

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,880
and they are interpreted as relations, right?

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,600
So, for example, the add is a ternary predicate,

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
the things that occur in the argument
positions can be interpreted.

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,240
Thanks to the first two points as elements of
this chosen set of which the structure is built.

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,120
And then for each triple of elements from that
set, this predicate could be true or false.

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,480
And that's exactly what a relation
is used for in mathematics.

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,440
It has to relate elements of sets and,
well, in this case, always the same set.

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Okay, then we can interpret
both the argument positions here

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,840
and a statement like these literals.

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:59,520
So, depending on what relation we have chosen for any
particular choice of predicate symbol and arguments,

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,440
we can say well, this is interpreted to
be true or false depending on the relation

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
that we have chosen for the interpretation
of this particular predicate.

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,440
Okay.

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,760
So, that would give us true values for the
literals, for the things that occur here.

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
Implications of predicates to arguments.

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
Then, of course, there are also
all these logical connectors.

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,680
And then certain rules are used.

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,200
Well, the rules of predicate logic to
assign true values also to formulas, right?

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,280
So, if we have two literals, then the
conjunction of them is interpreted to

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,560
be the logical conjunction of whether or
not both individually are actually true.

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:44,880
Okay.

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
And implication is interpreted
in the standard way.

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
The quantifiers are interpreted in the
standard way like if it says "for all x",

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,400
this statement then actually as in logic
for every element of that set that you

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,800
have chosen as the base structure on
which we have built our structure,

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,200
it must be the case that this relation
holds for zero and twice that element.

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
Okay, so this is then how we

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,960
can assign true values not just for two individual
literals, like the first three items here.

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,800
But actually, to a whole formula, including also,
of course, the compound formula that would be

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,600
obtained by translating all the facts and rules
from the program into this logical syntax.

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
Okay, and now we have these
possible interpretations.

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
Yes, we have many choices.

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
We can choose different sets
of mathematical objects.

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
We can choose different
interpretations of these constants.

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
So, we have a choice.

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,640
How we interpret this symbol zero in our overall
set that could be even infinitely many choices.

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
The same for these functions
that we have to choose.

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,640
All this is a choice.

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,320
And each combination of choices
here gives one interpretation.

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Then we can check whether this
interpretation given these

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,000
assignment rules, what true values we obtain
for the formula that corresponds to the program.

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,920
And we consider only those interpretations
that make all the given formulas true.

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,440
Well, given formula means translations of these
facts and rules, or if you have actually combined

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,600
them into a big conjunction, then there's
only one overall formula, which must be true.

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Okay, all the interpretations, all these choices
we can make here, or every instance of choice

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
that we have made here, for which actually the
formula corresponding to the program is true.

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
They are still true value or true.

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,360
Such interpretation is called a model.

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
Then we have a model of this logical formula.

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,880
And the semantics of a program is

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,600
said to be all those statements relationships
that are true in all models of the program.

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
We have a program that
corresponds to a logical formula,

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,800
we could, in principle, make very many different
choices for interpreting the syntactic ingredients

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,880
of the program, we only consider those for
which the program as a formula is true.

00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,520
Then we know what the models are.

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,840
Sort of the structures that make
our predicate satisfy our program.

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,800
And then it could be the case that in these
specific models further things are true.

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,640
Because we can deduce something
from the given material.

00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,320
And then exactly those statements, those
relationships that are true in all the models,

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,400
that is in all the interpretations
that make the program itself true.

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,480
These are the things that are that
make up the semantics of the program.

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,400
And then that of course means for
example, that if you could logically

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,800
deduce something from the formula, then
that will also be true in all the models.

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Exactly those things will be true in
all the models that are also logical

00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,240
consequences of the given
material background knowledge.

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,720
Okay?

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,560
And that's exactly what was the topic of a
chapter in Professor König's lecture, right?

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,840
So, how it is and how it makes
sense, this kind of model theory.

41 # slide
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,280
Now, this freedom one has on the
previous slide in choosing this

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
underlying set of mathematical
objects, often called the universe

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,600
is a problem when one wants to systematically
study consequences of a logic formula.

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,360
Yes, because there are too many models
in the sense that one would have to look

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,320
at if one really wants to establish validity of
consequences by checking them for all the models.

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,040
Okay?

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,000
Luckily, there's always the
kind of universal model one.

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,960
So, one model that sometimes
is enough to consider.

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,760
We don't have to consider all the possible
choices of the base set of mathematical objects.

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,720
Okay, and what's the idea?

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Well, the idea for this is very simple.

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,960
Namely, in some sense, we interpret this simple
as possible, namely, purely syntactically.

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,600
So, we don't actually consider an arbitrary set
of mathematical objects, we simply consider terms.

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,840
So, neither the functions
nor the predicates really

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
do anything in the sense that
they do any actual computation.

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,200
They are simply taken as what they are
written like, namely, as syntactic objects.

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,120
Okay, so what does this have as consequences?

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
Well, the set of objects will
simply be the set of ground terms.

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Yeah, we have some implicitly given signature
like zero and a successor symbol and

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,000
also predicates that simply
look at the constants and the

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,040
data constructors; we would have
zero and s in the previous example.

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,560
And we consider all the terms that can be
built over this, but only ground terms.

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,120
So, let's remember that was introduced in
a previous lecture, in a previous week.

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,200
Probably last week, that we construct ground
terms; that is, terms without variables.

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,360
Okay, so we consider all these
ground terms over implicit signature.

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,840
In this case, it would be zero, s of zero, s
of zero, s of s, s of, s of zero, et cetera.

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,720
These would be the objects that we
consider, syntactic application.

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,360
Okay, so what's the functor, then?

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,080
The data constructor?

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
Well, it does exactly this.

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
It simply applies syntax.

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,560
Yes.

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,320
So, if you apply the constructor s to the term s
of zero, then we get a new term s of s of zero.

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,440
So, simply consider interpretation as what we
would write down if you wrote it down as terms.

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,840
Okay, so no further interpretation
in some mathematical sense.

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,920
Okay, and the predicate; well, since
there should be relations over this

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,720
base set, we can now interpret this as
simply writing down those implications

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,080
of predicate symbols on ground terms,
that should be considered to be true.

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes, that's one way to
interpret or to represent a

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,880
relation on such syntactic set by simply saying
well, we make another set in which we collect

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,000
all the applications of our predicate symbols,
say the addition symbol on three ground terms.

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,000
But of course, not all of these combinations,
but only those which should be true in our

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,240
interpretation, in our understanding
of that predicate symbol or relation.

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Okay, and now this first thing here
is called the Herbrand universe.

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,720
And again, that's a notion that occurs
in Professor König's course as well.

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,640
So, Herbrand was the logician who considered
these specific structures, these specific models

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:35,200
then also to understand or to study better the
model theory for the kind of logic in use here.

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:42,560
Okay, so the Herbrand universe would now
be this space that is used from now on.

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,440
And well, what's written in the last line
here, so this some chosen set of syntactic

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,280
application of the predicate symbols on ground
terms that would be a Herbrand interpretation.

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,400
Because it tells us what is considered
to be true in a certain model.

00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,440
Okay, in Herbrand model.

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
Okay, so let's do this on an example.

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,880
So, that was our example.

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
From this, we can see what a signature is, right?

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,200
There is this constant simply 0 of arity 0.

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400
And the function symbol s of arity one, right?

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,840
Because it takes one argument
as we see, for example, here.

00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,280
Then, from this, we can
build a Herbrand universe.

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,680
So, all ground terms over the signature, and we
already indicated what this amounts to, namely,

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,400
all these nested applications.

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,520
And since there's only one data
constructor, there is no more choice.

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,200
So, it's always s of, s of, s of,
and at some point, it will be zero.

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,280
So, all these combinations, of course,
in some sense represent natural numbers.

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,040
But there is interpretation going on here, right?

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,280
This is just taken syntactically.

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,400
And importantly, in the Herbrand universe,
we don't use the predicate symbol.

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,680
So, really just look at the things
that can occur in argument positions.

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,520
The zero and the s of something.

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,840
Okay, and we don't consider variables in
here because these should be ground terms.

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,360
Okay, so that's the Herbrand universe.

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,720
And then there is the simplest
Herbrand interpretation, which would be

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,280
the Herbrand base, which would be simply
all applications of the predicate symbols.

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,680
Well, we have only one predicate
symbol here in the program

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,320
to all the possible terms from
the Herbrand universe, right?

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
So, this is the Herbrand base.

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,240
It's one specific Herbrand interpretation, but
not necessarily the one we are looking for.

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,640
Right?

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,640
The Herbrand interpretation would be
any subset of this very large set,

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,200
which contains all the dot,
dot, dot; here we actually would

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,480
have all applications of "add" to
any triple of elements from this set.

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,840
Including things that we intuitively
know to not be true, right?

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
We know that zero plus zero is not one, but
the Herbrand base doesn't care about this.

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,840
It contains all the applications of
predicate symbols on terms found in this,

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,840
in this case, infinite set, and later we have
actually the Herbrand interpretation, which is

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,800
more true in some sense, right?

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,880
So, more logically consistent.

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
But the Herbrand base is simply
all the applications here.

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,840
Okay.

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,280
So, what you're actually looking for, so the Herbrand
interpretation is a subset of the Herbrand base and

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,440
should be the Herbrand interpretation, which
makes the program true and nothing more.

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,800
Well, we should make exactly those things
true which are enforced by the given program.

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:37,840
Because then it's the perfect model from which we
can deduce all the things that would be deducible.

42 # slide
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,840
The next question then is whether
we can actually compute, in

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,240
somewhat constructive
fashion, this perfect model.

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
So, it would have to be the smallest

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
Herbrand interpretation that is a model,
smallest in the sense of "subset".

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Yes, because then we have exactly

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,440
collected all the things, all the
applications of predicates to ground

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,880
terms that then must be true because they are
consequent of the program, but nothing more.

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
So, the smallest Herbrand
interpretation that is a model.

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,540
Okay.

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,440
Well, a reasonable question would actually
be: Is there such a smallest interpretation?

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,680
Or maybe there are different
ones that are incomparable?

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
So, is there a smallest one?

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
And if so, can we compute?

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,720
Okay.

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
And the answer to both questions is yes.

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,040
And well, the method to do this is the so-called

00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,040
immediate consequence operator, which
sounds maybe a bit complicated.

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,840
And also has a definition that looks
complicated maybe at first glance,

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
but we will, in a moment, see
this applied to an example.

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,080
And we'll see that that's a very
intuitive process going on here.

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
Okay, so what is it?

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,200
It is an operator

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
that turns sets into new sets.

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,920
So, basically, you give it
a Herbrand interpretation,

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
and it gives you a new Herbrand interpretation.

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,800
So, it operates on the subsets of the thing of
the Herbrand base appearing on the previous slide.

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Okay, it's called the immediate
consequence operator because it always

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,640
computes new consequences, and they
are immediate consequences in the sense

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,400
that they must be obtainable from what
we already had in the previous set.

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
So, before we apply the operator,
they must be obtainable from this

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,880
by just one reasoning step by applying one fact
or one rule from our different program, right?

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,800
So, the program p basically
appears as a subscript.

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,480
So, the immediate consequence operator
is always relative to one program.

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,920
Okay, and then it operates
on these interpretations.

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,800
Okay, and what does it do?

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
Well, it takes one such set,

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,960
one such subset of the Herbrand base,
which is a Herbrand interpretation, then.

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,800
And it produces all ground literals.

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,040
So, these are things that can occur in a Herbrand

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,160
interpretation because they are exactly
the elements of the Herbrand base, right?

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,560
Predicate symbols applied to ground terms.

00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,920
So, it produces all ground literals and zero
for which holds: there are L1, L2, L3, … , Ln,

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,920
for some natural number n, which are already
in the current interpretation, right?

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,520
From which we want to draw a consequence.

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,840
So, we must have L1, L2 to Ln, already in the
given I such that the zero would be obtained,

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,640
if we take some fact or rule from the program that
instantiates it in some consistent way, right?

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
So, consistent in the sense that
if you have a fact or rule which

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,400
contains variable X, then we can replace
the X by any ground term, but of course,

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,400
we have to replace it the same in, for
example, all the literals accordingly.

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,480
Okay, so we have an I, we have rules,
we can instantiate them completely.

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,560
So that there are no variables left.

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,520
And then we do it in all possible ways, such
that we find L1 to Ln already in the current I.

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
And if so, then we put the L0 which of
course also has its variables replaced

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,680
by the things we have chosen for the
variables and put that zero in the next set.

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,400
So, in what Tp makes out of this I.

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
Okay, it's important to notice
that the n could be zero, right?

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,280
And you would have a rule with an empty
right-hand side, with an empty body,

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
that would be a fact, right?

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,000
So, the case of facts is also covered here,
that will be the case where n is zero,

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:27,600
then we simply put into the next set all
instantiations of all ground instantiations of our

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
fact if our head with the empty body.

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,920
Okay, so that's an operation on sets
that you will see in action in a moment.

00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
And what is it useful for?

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,680
Well, we can apply it to what?

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,120
Well, for example, to the empty set, we have to
start somewhere as a result of the empty set.

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,200
And then we can apply this operator to the
empty set, then we get maybe new elements.

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
So, the empty set grows into something non-empty,

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,120
then we can apply this consequence
operator again on that set.

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,560
And again, and again.

00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,200
And it's not difficult to see that by
doing this, the sets can only grow larger.

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,840
So, they cannot become smaller and
either at some point this becomes stable.

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,520
And there's one fixed final set, or we have also an
infinite set that somehow becomes stable at some point.

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,720
All this goes on and on and on and on forever.

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,560
But even then, mathematically, there's a limit.

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,920
So, there is at least an upper
bound for this infinite sequence.

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,880
And whatever this is, whether it happens at the
finite time, or it's just an infinite limit,

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,160
that will be the smallest Herbrand
model, the thing we're looking for.

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,600
Okay, so we get a fixed point or limit of
a sequence starting with the empty set,

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,120
applying this operation that's
defined here, on the empty set,

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,000
getting a new set, applying Tp to that
set, and then to that set, et cetera.

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,960
And either it stops at some point,
or it goes on and on forever.

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
But it never becomes smaller.

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,800
So, if we find some literal in some
of the sets, then we know it will also

00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,960
appear in the smallest Herbrand
model because the sets only grow.

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,760
So, once something appears in one of the sets,

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,880
we know it's something that's really
deducible from the program logically.

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,800
Because it appears in the
smallest Herbrand model.

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,840
And that's what we can use as
the meaning of the program.

43 # slide
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,480
Let us look at this as an example.

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
So, that's again, the same program.

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,760
And where we start from the empty set, we
don't have to write down the empty set,

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,880
but we should write down the first application
of the Tp operator on the empty set.

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,920
So, what will this be?

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Well, what do we have to do? We have to check
what right-hand sides of the given program

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,400
clauses we can already find in ground
instantiated form in our given set?

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,920
Where this given set at the beginning is the
empty set, it's already clear that there's

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,560
no point in even trying to use this second
rule in the immediate consequence operator.

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,480
Because there is no L1 on the right-hand
side that we could also find in the given I.

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,080
Okay, so in the first step, it only makes
sense to look at the facts of the program.

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,200
And then what do we have to do?

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
Well, in the case of a fact, we don't
have a right-hand side to consider.

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,200
So, all we have to do is to check or to
consider all the ground instantiations

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,760
of this head and add them
to the set to our next set.

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,520
Okay, and what would our
ground instantiations here be?

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,960
Well, there is one variable occurring twice.

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,800
So, we have to consider all ground terms
and replace them for X but of course, for

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,120
both occurrences of X.

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,160
Okay, so what this means is that the first
application of the Tp operator on the empty set,

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,320
gives us this already infinite set
with a clear repeating pattern, right?

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,640
So, we get 0, 0, 0.

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
Of course, we can replace both X with the zero,

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
we can also replace both X by another
element of the Herbrand universe.

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,240
Maybe s of zero.

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,120
Then we get this literal into our set and
do the same for s of zero, et cetera.

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,720
So, here we plug in elements from the Herbrand
universe that we have established earlier,

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,440
two slides back.

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,800
Okay, so that's what happens
in the first iteration.

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,640
Then we do this again.

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
We apply Tp again now on this set.

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
So, what will this mean?

00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,840
Well, of course, it would still or
again, get all these elements, right?

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,800
Because in the next step, we can
still look at the first fact.

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,920
It has no right-hand side, so we don't
have to find anything in the previous set.

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,360
We can simply add all ground
instantiations of the thing.

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,160
But that would only add things that
we've already seen; that doesn't

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,400
make sense or doesn't give
anything interestingly new.

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,040
So, it is more important in the next
step to look at the actual rules.

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,680
Because now we do have stuff
already in our current set.

00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,600
So, we can actually look in this set for
ground instantiations of this right-hand side.

00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,400
And for any choice of x, y, and z for
which we find an element here, we can add

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,160
on the next iteration, the corresponding
instantiation of the head of this rule.

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
Okay, so we get all we have already.

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,280
And that will always be the case; I already
mentioned that the sets can only grow.

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,880
So, each consecutive set has
the previous set as a subset,

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,080
and then new stuff may be added or it
becomes stationary and the sequence stops.

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,280
Okay, so here we get what we already had, plus…

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,400
Well, plus what?

00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,080
For example, since this can be taken as an
instantiation for this right-hand side here,

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,680
if you choose X, Y, and Z to all
three be zero, we have to add s of X,

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,120
s of zero, Y zero, s of Z, zero.

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,080
So, from this literal, we get this new literal.

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
And similarly, we get new literals

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,760
actually, for each of the ones we have
already in our current set, right?

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,320
Because of this, because we can also choose
X to be zero, Y, and Z to both be s of zero.

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,640
From this follows this new predicate.

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,760
Mathematically new literal predicate
application in the next iteration.

00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,720
And same here.

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
And of course, from each of these
instantiations for each of the

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,760
literals occurring in this dot, dot,
dot, you also get a new one here.

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,400
Okay, let me do this again.

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,240
And again, and again.

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,920
Right, and here we already…
I don't have the arrows here.

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,440
But again, from each new thing that
occurred in the previous iteration,

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,080
we get yet another new one
for the next iteration, right?

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,600
We get everything we already have.

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Plus, new stuff in this example; that need not
always be the case, but here it is the case.

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,920
Okay, so this would actually go on and on.

00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,120
And if we then take a very
sharp look and consider well,

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,440
what would actually be the limit of
this if we did this infinite times?

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,800
Well, actually the limit would be
this set which can't be written down

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,360
by finite enumeration, of course.

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,640
Because it contains infinitely many
elements; already the first set here

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,040
does, and then certainly
all the others do as well.

00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,720
What would actually appear here you
can actually see this pattern already.

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,600
If you look at the examples here, we always
get for all choices eventually of i and j:

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,440
s, i times applied to zero, s, j times
applied to zero, s, i+j times applied to zero.

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,680
Right?

00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,920
So, here you will never find anything which
isn't a logical consequence of these rules.

00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,480
You get 2 + 2 = 4; 2 + 1 = 3.

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
So, you don't get stupid stuff here,

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
you only get stuff that is actually
a consequence of the given program.

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,160
And actually, also everything that intuitively

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,440
is a consequence of this definition
of addition will eventually appear.

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,760
That's what this last line
here is actually claiming

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,960
or proves here, but it's the
fact that this will happen.

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Okay, in that sense, this
process captures exactly

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,480
the meaning of this addition
predicate of this definition.

44 # slide
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,440
So, this was just one example.

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,480
So, of course, the question is now: Does
this always work, for all Prolog programs?

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,000
Is it always possible to do this,
to work with this Tp semantics?

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,640
And well, the answer is not for
all parts of the Prolog language.

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
So, for example, arithmetic.

00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,720
So, the use of this "is" construct
is to actually evaluate things.

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,840
And this is not covered by
this declarative semantics,

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,560
mainly because the semantics is
so symbolically oriented, right?

00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,720
So, this arithmetic really computing two
plus five is seven is exactly something

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,640
which is not purely syntactic, so
it doesn't really fit this approach.

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
So, that is something that will
not be covered by the semantics.

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
And of course, you also don't have to

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,800
apply this declarative semantics
on programs containing arithmetic.

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,200
But there are also other things,
other constraints that we are under.

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,720
So, for example, negation is generally
problematic with declarative semantics.

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,720
So, we will not consider this.

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:52,560
So, neither negation in the form of this
unequal predicate, nor general negation

00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,320
of some literal will be considered in
the context of declarative semantics.

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,240
Because it doesn't really work.

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,120
Right?

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,040
The interpretation of "not" is something
that has to be understood operationally.

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,200
At least, if one uses the simple declarative semantics
that we have seen. There are more elaborate versions

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,800
in the literature that can also deal with
negation, but that's not for this course.

00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,480
So, in the course, let's simply say,

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,840
you're not going to use negation in programs for
which you want to use the declarative semantics.

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,040
Also in exercises, etc., this will not appear.

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,040
And moreover, there are
also in the Prolog language

00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,960
despite it being a logical programming language,
there are also features that are not really logical.

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,800
They are not introduced in this lecture.

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:41,360
So, here we anyway restrict the logical part of
Prolog and, well, if the extra-logical features,

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,600
we would also have to deal with the fact
that they don't follow this semantics.

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,120
So, they're not really compatible with the
semantics because it is really driven by

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
a model theory from logic.

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
So, if we have something that
isn't really logic, then it doesn't

00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,080
fit with the semantics. Okay, these are the
constraints that the semantics works under.

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,680
Okay, so for you, of course, we will
make sure that this is always satisfied

00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,280
if you get a program for which you
should check the declarative semantics.

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,480
Okay.

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,600
But this, of course, doesn't mean that there are
no interesting programs for which you can do this.

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,800
Of course, there are, and you will
see some in the exercises, etc.

00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,640
And also here, I have another example,
which is only slightly more complicated.

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,160
But at least it already has two
predicates and definitions for them.

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,840
And one calls the other that
could even be mutual recursion,

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
even though this doesn't occur in this example.

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,280
But you could have many predicates that you
can call each other mutually recursive if we

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,560
have here also a program predicate with more
than two rules, with two facts and one rule.

00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,080
We have a case here on the right-hand
side, we have several literals, etc.

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,320
So, you really, from this example, you can see
the more elaborate version of this iteration.

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,240
I will not talk through this
in detail here in the slides.

00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,280
So, I do have the slides.

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,000
And you can also see what happens
in each of the iterations.

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,280
But I will not explain each step
because in the collection document

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,600
in the Moodle course, where I have
exercise tasks and their solutions.

00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,880
There's actually a very similar example
where this was really spelled out

00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,520
in a lot of detail where really each step
is explained and how and why certain new

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,280
literals appear in the next iteration of the
Tp operator, which is explained in detail.

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,120
So, that corresponds then to the
arrows I had on the previous slide.

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:40,000
And here again, where basically I'm saying, well,
because these two literals were in this iteration,

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
now, this new element occurs
in this iteration, right?

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,040
So, I am not explaining this here in detail, but
well, if you read through the text explanation of

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,560
that other example in the collection PDF, then
you find exactly such explanations of steps.

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,200
Why is something appearing exactly in
the iteration where it is appearing?

00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,360
Right.

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,640
So, what you can get from this example
here, I'm not explaining each step

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
is how this grows and grows and grows.

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,480
And you will always get new knowledge about, in
this case, the addition and the multiplication

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,240
predicate.

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,960
How new knowledge is established step by step

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,400
when we apply this immediate
consequence operator repeatedly.

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay, so here's something
in the first iteration only

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
knowledge from the facts was accumulated, right?

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,120
Because as in the previous example
we don't use the rules with

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
actual right-hand sides in the first iterations.

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,440
On the first iteration, we had only

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,480
instantiations of these three facts and
then in later iterations, new stuff appears.

45 # slide
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,840
So, here for example, but also
again here, we get new material.

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,560
Okay, so, here are two cases where we have
written down why a certain new literal appears.

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,400
So, this appears because we
had this in the set, right?

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,480
It wasn't in the set because, of course,
this set is the whole thing we see here.

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,600
So, actually, there is an invocation
of this last rule, where the fact

00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,280
that this was present before and
this was present before now leads

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,680
to this new literal and likewise
for something that occurred here.

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,040
And the concrete literal here,
this leads to this, et cetera.

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,920
Okay, ultimately you get this for
example, after four steps of applying this

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,080
immediate consequence operator method.
When we go on and on and on, we

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:46,880
get all the valid statements about addition and
multiplication on such symbolic natural numbers.

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
Okay, that's it for now.

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,240
And you have the material in the collection.pdf,
you will have an exercise task, of course, on this.

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,840
And next week, we will turn
to the operational semantics,

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,840
to a different perspective on
the meaning of Prolog programs.
