00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,240
In the previous lecture last week, we talked
about the declarative semantics of Prolog.

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
That was the semantics built on Herbrand models.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,240
That is syntactic models where we have
syntactic terms as the ingredients and

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,480
we work with the immediate consequence
operator to enrich from the empty set

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,440
such sets of symbolic terms until either
we reach a stable state or ad infinitum,

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,760
we construct the limit of an
infinite sequence of sets.

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,200
So, this was the mathematical
semantics for Prolog programs.

00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,360
Today, we will look at the so-called
operational semantics for Prolog.

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,480
And before doing this, just a few words.

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,520
In some sense, a repetition or recognition of
things that apply to declarative semantics,

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
which also to some extent explain why the
operational semantics is also considered.

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
Because they are not exactly equivalent.

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
They are different from the situation of
Haskell where notational semantics, the

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,440
mathematical thinking and meaning,
set-theoretical interpretation of function

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,000
definitions is in very good correspondence
to the operational evaluation semantics.

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,800
Okay, so what was the declarative semantics?

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,840
Whatever it was, is contained
in the previous video.

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,720
And it was applicable and it was discussed

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,800
towards the end of that video to
certain purely logical programs.

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,720
So, for example, arithmetic,
evaluation of additions,

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
multiplications, et cetera, was something that's
not explained by the declarative semantics.

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
Because it's not purely syntactic.

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,800
There was also a problem with negation
that was mentioned that this is not

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,600
at least not in general in reach of
this declarative semantics approach.

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
And also features we will not cover at all.

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,080
So, non-logical features that Prolog
has that we will not consider in the

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,000
course are also outside the domain, outside
the reach of this Herbrand model semantics.

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, so this is one downside of that semantics.

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,320
Whereas the operational semantics does cover
these features well because the operational

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,720
semantics is really what the implementation
of a Prolog interpreter is based upon.

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,920
And this interpreter, of course, has to
handle all the features of the language.

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
Okay, so this is already some constraint.

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Also, that was already mentioned last week,

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
the declarative semantics does not really
talk about queries containing variables.

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,760
So, what you construct in the Herbrand
semantics are sets of ground terms.

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,000
So, this explains exactly which queries would
be successful given that we instantiate all the

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,080
argument positions of predicates, but for queries
with variables, this is not directly applicable.

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
Again, we didn't claim that it is.

00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,680
Something you can't

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,440
see at the moment, but probably will agree to
want to once we have introduced the operational

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,560
semantics is that the Herbrand models
semantics is mathematically very basic.

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
I mean, it might not be easy for you because
you first have to learn how this works,

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,320
but from the mathematical side,
this is very straightforward.

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
It has a very simple definition.

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,480
Basically, the immediate consequence
operator was one slide of a definition.

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
That was all that it is.

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
For declarative semantics,
there are more ingredients

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,200
that have to come together and work
together to establish the semantics.

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,800
So, in that sense, declarative semantics
is still the mathematically simpler one,

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,600
that's why it is also nicer for
proving properties, for example.

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,360
Nevertheless, these semantics are related.

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,240
So, they are not equivalent.

00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,120
I just mentioned this already, but
they are related in a suitable way.

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,880
So, in particular for those programs
where both semantics are applicable.

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,480
So, if you do not use the
non-logical features, then

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,920
one could state as a theorem
how these two semantics relate.

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,160
And well, this relation is
some kind of equivalence.

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,840
So, they are not separate and telling
different things about the same program.

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,920
Okay.

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,920
And one important aspect that wasn't relevant
so far is that the declarative semantics simply

00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,760
as an observation, because it's purely set
based and it never considers, for example,

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,760
the order of literals appearing in the
right-hand side of a rule or of a query.

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,880
Simply by the definition, this semantics that
we are seeing is completely insensitive against

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,920
changes in the order of text and words
or of the order of literals within rules.

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Yes, so that simply didn't appear; it
didn't play any role in the semantics.

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,360
So, of course, if you change the order of rules or
the order of stuff in the right-hand side of a rule,

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,040
this can't possibly make any change
to the declarative semantics.

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,600
As you will see for the operational
semantics, it does make a difference.

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
And that can be an important point,

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
because operational semantics explains
what the Prolog interpreter is doing.

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
And we have already encountered
earlier in the slides,

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,480
a strange situation where I said, for
example, that an indication of a literal,

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,280
if it should occur in a rule, should
occur towards the end of that rule.

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,960
So, it must be something in the context
of negation where the order is important.

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,680
So, the declarative semantics can't explain this
because it doesn't take care of the order at all.

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
So, that's something that we
definitely need operational semantics.

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,040
And indeed, the first motivating example
for why we want operational semantics will

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,680
really depend on, and will be related to,
this observation in the last item here.

47 # slide
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,000
So, operational semantics, as already
mentioned, corresponds somewhat to

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,320
the execution of Haskell programs by
lazy evaluation through pattern-matching.

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,200
So, also when I talked earlier
in the Prolog part about the

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,280
operational intuition of how a program is executed,
I already made a connection to pattern-matching.

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,240
However, we will see that there are more
complicated ingredients for the operational

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
semantics of Prolog, because we do not just
need pattern-matching, but actually a more

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
general concept called unification.

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,720
And as also already mentioned,
various of these ingredients

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,200
that we need for the operational semantics,
namely unification and resolution,

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:42,000
are already present in the Logik lecture
that is given by Professor König.

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,360
And those are also contained in the slide
excerpt that I linked to in the Moodle course.

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,080
Okay, but before we get to this, let
us look at some cases where it seems

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,640
a good idea to have operational semantics and
not just rely on the declarative semantics.

00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,480
So, we will go through a few examples
of maybe a bit surprising behavior of

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,360
certain Prolog programs that we will later be
able to explain with the operational semantics.

48 # slide
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
So, let us look at this program.

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Yes, a small database of connections supposedly
of direct flights in the first four lines.

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:34,480
So, for some city constant, we say that
there are direct connections, direct flights.

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,520
And then we have a predicate that defines
what a connection is, which could be

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
a multistep flight.

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,840
So, a direct flight is also a connection,

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,720
but you can also have a situation where
we have a direct flight from x to z and

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,600
then onwards connecting from z to y, which
maybe arises from another direct flight.

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,920
But anyway, a connection
from z to y then altogether,

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,920
you also have a connection from x
to y, which might be indirect, okay?

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
So, that's a useful definition.

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,480
And we can use it with some queries.

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,600
So, we can ask whether there is a
connection from Frankfurt to Maui.

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,680
And then by combining this, it would be basically
computing the transitive closure of the direct

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,880
relationship. Prolog finds that
yes, there is such a connection.

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,200
You could also have a variable X and ask whether that
is anything that you can reach from San Francisco.

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,360
And actually, what is reachable from San
Francisco by using a variable in the query here?

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,720
And the answers will be that, well,
there is a connection to Honolulu,

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,520
there's a connection to
Maui, but no further ones.

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,200
And again, this could be worked out
from the rules here also intuitively.

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
Okay, and we can ask questions like, is
there a connection from Maui to somewhere?

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,960
And the answer is no, because there's
no direct connection, as we can see.

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
And then there can also
be no indirect connection.

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,120
Okay, so what we see here can be explained
still by the declarative semantics.

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
The first one immediately, because this would be

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:15,760
seen in the Herbrand model that there is this
connection with Frankfurt, Maui, literal.

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,560
And in these ones, the other two values
could be explained from the Herbrand

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,120
semantics or in the collection PDF document.

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,760
Actually, for this program, there is the
computation of the smallest Herbrand model.

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,360
And for example, by looking at the set, the
final set that is obtained there, and checking

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,280
which connection literals occur where the
first position is set to San Francisco,

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,360
then we will actually also find these two.

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,280
Because there's a connection between San
Francisco and Honolulu, as a literal.

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,520
There is a connection between San
Francisco and Maui, as a literal.

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,200
And there are no other literals with San
Francisco as the first connection point, okay?

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
That also explains this query and likewise,

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,680
we will not find any connection
to Maui in first position.

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,760
So, also this operational result of the
interpreter is explained by declarative semantics.

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Okay, that looks like everything is fine.

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,120
Yes, the declarative semantics
explains what the program is doing.

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
However, let's see the next slide.

49 # slide
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,720
So, we have made a very innocent
change actually to the program.

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,960
Namely, we have simply switched
the order of fact and rule.

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,040
So, this was previously the first line of the
connection definition, now it's the second line.

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,800
And in the non-basic case,
we have simply switched the

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,520
positions of
direct and connection, right?

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,840
Previously, it was said that there must be a direct
flight from x to z and a connection from z to y.

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,640
Now I'm saying that there must be a connection
from x to z and a direct flight from z to y.

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Logically, in terms of the meaning of this
program, that should make a difference, right?

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
It's still expressing the same concept
of direct and multistep connections.

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,120
However, running this program now in
Prolog and asking a similar question

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,920
as on the previous slide, suddenly
gets an error, a runtime error, okay?

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
So, something has gone wrong.

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,000
I made an innocent change, but the behavior
of the program is now very bad, okay?

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,840
This also means that these logical operations,
which basically underlie this program or the

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,720
interpretation of Prolog facts and rules,
et cetera, it's not commutative, right?

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
I said I changed the order of these two

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,720
clauses and that would correspond to an
error because previously we said that several

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,840
clauses correspond to a conjunction of statements,
or by simply switching the order here.

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,920
Logically, this would mean from A or B, I made
B or A, that shouldn't really make a difference.

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
And similarly, also when the rules of connection

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,200
and direct are changed here, that could
be seen as something like an “and”.

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,960
Or it's not exactly just switching the two
parts here, but anyway it's strange that

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:22,240
this would have such a big impact where "and" is
a logical operation and it should be commutative.

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,520
Okay?

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,080
So, that's somehow strange.

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,920
And, of course, it also means that
this program execution somehow

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,480
has more aspects to it than
just a purely logical reading.

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
Because with the logical side,
there shouldn’t be a difference.

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,480
Yes.

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,160
So, this program here has the exact same

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,760
smallest Herbrand model as the previous program,
but the behavior is completely different.

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,840
So, something is going on.

50 # slide
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:04,480
Another slightly more subtle example: we have
also already seen the additional predicate

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:12,080
earlier in the lecture and also seen how
we can use it to define subtraction, right?

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:20,320
This was a recursive definition for addition
and we said x – y = z if z + y = x.

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,240
Okay, and we have seen some
cases how this nicely works.

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,960
Okay, let me say I would have made some
slightly different implementation decisions.

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,640
So, for example, for the addition, I would
have decided that I actually want to make my

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,880
case extensions on the second argument.

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,400
So, basically, I have changed
the roles of the first two

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
arguments here, but other than that,
this is really the same strategy.

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
Yeah, so there is no big difference.

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,200
This is also a reasonable
definition of addition.

00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Yes, x + 0 = x and x plus the successor of something
is the successor of something else if x and the

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,960
other thing of which I took a successor of here
is the thing from which this is the successor.

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,520
Okay, so this makes mathematically perfect sense.

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,840
There's no reason we need to prefer this version
over this one in terms of what addition means.

00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,120
Okay?

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,960
And then I could also hope, well, if
this is a useful definition for addition,

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,160
then this would also be a useful
definition for the subtraction still.

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
Because it has the same
declarative nature as before;

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,840
Defining subtraction in terms of addition.

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
Okay, so all is fine.

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,520
Logically, these both are
equally useful programs.

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,760
However, that might change when we look
at instantiations on queries, right?

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,280
So, for example, here we can run 2 - 1,
and we get a useful result: 1.

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
Okay, that's good.

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,600
What happens if you ask questions
like, N - M should be 1?

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Yes, that's something we also did for
this example earlier in the lecture.

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:10,160
Let's do this for this definition, which
mathematically is just as fine as this one.

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, so what will happen?

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,960
Nothing very useful.

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,320
Above here, we had this result repeated from
an earlier slide, but what's happens down here?

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,400
Where instead of getting a nice solution
like here, where we get n = s (m).

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
That was the thing that I said;

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,800
an infinite number of answers to this
query is expressed in a very compact form.

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,280
Instead, in this definition, suddenly we
don't get such a closed-form solution,

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,080
instead we get an enumeration of results
like, well, n could be one, m could be zero,

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,120
or n could be two and m could be one, and so on.

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,400
So, here we can get suddenly get
an infinite sequence of results.

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,360
Whereas here we got a very nice closed form.

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
Okay, so the choice and treatment of the

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,680
arguments here suddenly affect at least the
quality of the results in a sense that it is a

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,920
nicer result because it gives one solution rather
than an enumeration of infinitely many ones.

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,640
Okay, and this happened just by

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,840
some small seemingly innocent change
to the definition of the addition.

51 # slide
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,080
And these changes can really
have undesirable consequences.

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,240
So, let's look at just another example

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,440
instead of addition and subtraction,
let's look at addition and multiplication.

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:44,260
Yes, once we have an addition, definitely we can
also define multiplication; 0 * something is 0.

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:53,600
And s(x) * y is z if we can easily work out
by multiplying X and Y to U, and then adding

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Y again, you actually get
the outcome of X + 1 * Y.

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,200
So, this is a nice descriptive solution for
computing multiplication on top of addition.

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,680
Let's run it where this works quite
nicely for various kinds of queries.

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,800
So, we can, for example, multiply
two and three to get six.

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,600
Or we can basically divide.

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,840
We can ask: Which N satisfies 2 * N = 4?

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,840
So, this is really saying,
how do we divide four by two?

00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,880
And the answer is two.

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,680
So, this is nice.

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,320
And it has this flexible flavor where we

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,880
don't have to commit whether we want
to go forward or backward, right?

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,600
Just as we did for addition earlier, however,
there is also a very strange situation.

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,160
So, with this very same definition, we
might also ask ourselves, or Prolog,

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
what two things do we have to
multiply to get the answer four?

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,600
Yes, that would be a factorization of a number.

00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Okay, what will happen?

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Well, Prolog will happily say, well, one and
four is the solution and indeed 1 * 4 = 4.

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,920
We can also say well, 2 * 2 is a solution.

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes, two and two could be used for N
and M because two times two is four.

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,880
So, now we would also hope that ultimately,
we also get the answer 4 * 1 is 4.

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,720
However, suddenly, the Prolog program
runs seemingly into an infinite loop.

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,800
So, indeed, if you didn't abort the program here,

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,120
then either it would run forever or it would
maybe finish by some resource exhaustion.

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Yes, no space left or whatever.

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,040
But it wouldn't give the final answer 4 * 1,
which is very disappointing because for addition,

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,360
this worked very nicely to work with the
same predicate forwards and backwards.

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,220
Yes.

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,880
One way to put it here is to say that
multiplication supports the so-called call mode;

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:06,080
+X, +Y, ?Z and +X, ?Y, +Z. So, this is a
way in Prolog libraries document so that,

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,280
for example, multiplication can
be used by providing input.

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
That's what the plus means, providing
concrete inputs for the first two positions,

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,720
and asking for a third position, right?

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
So, this will work nicely.

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
It will also work nicely to provide
inputs for the first and last positions

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,000
and asking about the middle
position. This also works nicely.

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
That is a different call mode, but
there's also one that won’t work,

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
at least not nicely, right?

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,040
So, for example, here we
see that we can’t in general

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:45,040
use this predicate by providing the third argument
position and asking for the other two, right?

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,960
It works to some extent, but not fully.

52 # slide
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,640
And this is really in contrast to
things we have seen earlier, right?

00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:01,600
If we just look at addition, so that's what we
did previously in this context, then the very same

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,120
call mode where we provide the last argument
and ask for the other two works quite well.

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,440
As we can ask which N and M in
addition, give the value of 3?

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,240
And well then, Prolog will happily
produce exactly all the correct solutions.

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,320
And for multiplication, suddenly this
didn't work on the previous slide.

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes, so indeed addition supports all call modes,
even calling it a three-variable or not providing

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,040
any concrete input like this concrete value
here, addition will still do something useful,

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,960
which certainly the multiplication from the
previous slide didn't because already, if some

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
place is filled with concrete values,

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,160
it's already failed to produce useful
outputs for the other position, okay?

00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
Whereas for addition this works.

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,680
So, the question is, why is this so different?

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,440
Why does it work for addition?

00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,040
For this definition of addition?

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,680
Why doesn't it work for the
multiplication definition?

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,400
And the declarative semantics can't explain this.

00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Moreover, not just why it's different
and why does the multiplication not work,

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,320
we can also ask whether we can
do something to the definition,

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,200
so that the multiplication function
will also work in this flexible way.

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,120
And again, the declarative semantics can't
explain this or can't help us. We really need

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,600
to have an insight into the operational
semantics to know how to change the

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,280
program from the previous slide to also
make my multiplication work more flexibly.

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,600
And indeed, this will be a running
example later in the slides where

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,040
the concrete execution is explained, we
will actually do this and explore various

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,160
cases by looking at the addition and
multiplication combination and trying to make

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,840
the program more flexible by
understanding how it will be executed.

53 # slide
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,200
And as a final example
here for what is strange or

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,880
highly declarative semantics, it's not enough
to explain the behavior of all Prolog programs.

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
Let's look at this example again.

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,600
So, it was from the first
lecture in the Prolog part.

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
We have defined these basic concepts

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,960
and this relation up there with their first
three facts and then this jealousness concept.

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,440
And at that point, I simply said that if
you have a negation occurring in a query,

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,560
or you should always put it at the end.

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,720
And I said, well, it's just like that you
simply should accept this at that point.

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
Well, what would have happened
if we had not done this?

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,920
So, let's say we changed this in a
very minor way by moving this negated

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,600
constraint first, to the front of this
right side of this loves-rule, okay?

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,360
Again, logically that
shouldn't make a difference.

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,840
If the comma is really a logical “and”. And
“and” as we know, is a commutative operation,

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,160
then it shouldn’t make a difference whether this
is put here or here or actually at the front.

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,560
However, this logical reading apparently is not

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,520
fully sufficient to understand what's going
on because if you actually run the second

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
program here after that small change,
then we get very strange results, right?

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,440
So, basically, nobody is jealous of anybody.

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,800
Yes, “Marsellus is not jealous of anybody”, says
the answer to this first query, even though we

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,920
previously established that actually there
is jealousy with Marsellus and someone.

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,400
And the same happens for basically
all the queries we have here, right?

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Even if you ask with two variables,
we don't get any results.

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Nobody is jealous, right?

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,080
That's not what we understood
this conceptualization to mean.

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
Indeed, before this change,
we got meaningful results.

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,920
You can go back to the first slides of Prolog,
then you get much more reasonable results here.

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,600
But somehow this small change
made a big difference here.

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,080
Okay, the declarative semantics can't
explain this because it doesn't even

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,440
capture any cases of negation, okay?

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
So, we would really need operational semantics.

00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,360
I don't know whether we will actually get

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,280
to the point, where we in operational
semantics define how negation is treated.

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,360
So, this is possible for the operational
semantics in contrast with declarative semantics.

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,280
We might not actually get to that point in the

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,960
course because there’s only one
and a half lectures left basically.

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,640
But well, we would use the operational
semantics and not the declarative semantics

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
for undertaking this problem.

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,600
And that's the point here
because I want to motivate why,

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,840
at all, to look at operational semantics.

54 # slide
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,920
Okay, so we should look at the
operational semantics to understand

00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,000
these phenomena that I just
showed on the previous slides.

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,160
So, we have to know how Prolog
concretely executes programs.

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,640
That's what operational semantics explains.

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,400
And to establish this and to build
for this, we need several ingredients.

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,520
Yes.

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,720
As I already mentioned, this is

00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,600
a more complicated setup than just the
construction for the declarative semantics.

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,320
Okay, there are basically three
things we need: unification,

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,800
resolution and the concept:
visualization of derivation trees.

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,040
The first two of these are
already in the Logik course.

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,760
There's also some notion
of tree-shaped resolution,

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,120
but it's not exactly the version
that is applied in Prolog.

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,120
The third item here is something that
is not covered by the previous material.

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,880
The slides in the Moodle course from
Professor König's lecture. But the first two

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,800
actually are there, just the concepts,
also occurring in the last Logik lecture.

00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:08,080
I will provide some repetition on this, but I will
not provide a full formulation of these concepts.
