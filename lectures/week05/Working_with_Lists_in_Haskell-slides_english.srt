00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:08,250
Okay, so I wanted to start by giving
some observations from the exercises.

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:17,580
And to some extent, I - of course - have
already done so in the previous video.

71 # slide
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:26,180
In particular, I talked there about the eta-reduction
aspect that Autotool or HLint sometimes warns

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,180
you about.

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,180
Some of you have already seen
this in your own submissions.

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,540
I don't have to talk through this again here
in this slide because it is in the previous

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
video.

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,909
So, here you have just another example,
something that occurred probably last year.

00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:49,249
So, again, the same idea: having a function
that takes an argument which it simply passes

00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,839
on to another function.

00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,449
So, somebody defined a ball function
which takes a "time" and gives a Picture.

00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:57,749
And how is "ball" defined?

00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:04,089
At any time t, it gives a solid circle of
radius t, which is exactly the same as simply

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,600
saying: "ball is this solidCircle function".

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,330
Defining "ball" as an alias, a different name
for the solidCircle function, expresses the

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,130
same idea as saying "ball at a given time
t is solidCircle at that given time t".

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,810
And the second version is a bit more elegant.

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,289
Even just pragmatically, you could say:

00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,689
At least you don't have to
think about the parameter name.

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,030
In this case, maybe t is the obvious choice;
but in another situation, you might not have

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,550
a good idea how to name your parameter.

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:44,110
Well, if you use eta-reduction, you
don't always have to name the parameters.

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:52,210
And we also saw this example in the taped
video demonstration with the opening rectangle.

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,960
And I want to emphasize here that the 'flip' function
that I used there in order to turn this into

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,400
a rectangle that opens in the other direction,
was not a Picture-specific primitive.

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,020
So, it was not flipping the Picture.

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,450
It was flipping the 'rectangle' function.

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,700
So, it would apply to any
function of two arguments.

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,650
In this case, for the 'rectangle' function,
it exactly has the effect that geometrically,

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,959
the shape of the rectangle is flipped because
we flipped the parameter arguments of the

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:20,959
'rectangle' function.

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,760
But the 'flip' function itself, it's not
a function that operates on pictures only.

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,040
It is a function that operates on other functions;
in this case, on the 'rectangle' function.

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,989
And you have seen this in action, what
this actually means for this case.

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,140
And another remark maybe at this point is:

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,260
The fact that we have eta-reduction, or that
this can be applied, also has a certain impact

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,890
on the design of APIs in Haskell.

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:54,540
So, if you have to think about how, for example,
the parameter order of your self-defined function

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,599
should be, it is worthwhile to think about
which is the parameter that maybe is often

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,769
passed on to somewhere else.

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,439
Because then it would make sense to make this
parameter the last parameter, because then

00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,489
you can apply this trick, this
eta-reduction refactoring.

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,720
That is also actually the reason, one could
argue, for CodeWorld always having the Picture

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
as the last argument in the
transformation functions.

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,780
If you think about the 'translated' function
for example, it takes two coordinates and

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,780
the Picture.

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,010
It could also take the Picture and then the
two coordinates, but then one couldn't in

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,060
some situations, where it is
useful, apply the eta-reduction.

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,430
So, it makes sense in designing an API, designing
the function types of a library, for example,

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,870
in Haskell or other similar languages, to
always put the data structure argument (which

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,909
in this case is the Picture argument, and
not the parameter arguments for moving in

00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:53,930
the x- and y-directions) as the last argument.

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,160
Because this opens up possibilities
to make good use of eta-reduction.

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,980
It is not super relevant for you at the moment,
because you are not defining your own libraries,

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,030
or designing libraries for
someone else's consumption.

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,049
But it is still maybe interesting to
at least be aware of this choice.

72 # slide
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:24,380
Then another observation, which is also a recurring
one, and in particular was seen in task 8.

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:33,530
That was apparent from some of your submissions,
namely, the overuse of access-by-index.

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,680
As a rule of thumb in Haskell, if you access
a data structure by index, then usually that

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,210
is not the best choice of expression.

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,419
And sometimes, we will
actually actively prevent this.

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:51,440
And I tried in the case of task 8 to prevent this with
my Moodle message a few days ago (in another year).

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I explained that you were supposed to really
work with the list as a whole, and not some

00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,820
special cases.

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,400
I saw some people using index access, which
is possible in Haskell, but usually not the

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
best choice.

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,710
And even the task description, in this case,
indicated that you should try to use a list

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,710
comprehension.

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,500
So, what do I mean by this?

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,860
Consider something like this:

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,620
Some list is taken, from this list we
take some arguments, one after the other.

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,250
Some argument is being drawn from this list, and
then we compute something from this argument,

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,020
put all results in a list, and
then we do whatever with this list.

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:36,770
So, this is a nice rich expression in the
form of what I also introduced last week in

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,400
examples.

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,160
Of course, you could, and some people
did do, instead write code like this.

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,090
So, what is this saying?

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,729
It is saying:

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:53,110
Give me the list and I take the length and
then I will build an index from zero (because,

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,460
as you will find out, list indexing in
Haskell starts with the index zero).

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:08,830
So, compute the index to be each value from
zero to the length of the list - 1, and then

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,729
access the list elements by this index, then
compute something from this, and do whatever

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:14,729
with it.

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:20,010
The expressions that you see here are equivalent
in the sense that they compute the same thing,

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,560
but the first one is the idiomatic one.

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,950
The first one is what
really expresses the intent.

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:31,139
The second one is somehow artificially working
with indices and is not very elegant, and

00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,740
also not very well maintainable.

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:43,690
This is sometimes called indexitis (the
sickness of using too many indices).

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:51,141
That might be the only choice to work with
data structures in some other languages, but

00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:52,479
certainly not in Haskell.

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,479
So, try to work in the spirit
of the first example here.

73 # slide
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,560
This also brings us to more
generally working with lists.

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,460
So, this will be the topic of the next few
slides and probably for most of this video.

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,669
Of course, you cannot only work with list
comprehensions in Haskell when you work with

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:15,669
lists.

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,669
There are other functions.

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,710
There is actually a small but powerful
library of functions on lists.

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,020
But even then, list indexing is the last resort.

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,050
So, usually, it's not a good
idea to work with list indices.

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,889
I can't stress this enough.

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:39,599
Nevertheless, first, a few more general comments
on lists and then I will introduce some of

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,620
the functions that you might want to
use for some of the next exercise tasks.

74 # slide
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:53,240
Generally, what is apparent once you look
at the next few lectures and exercises is

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,509
that we will, from now on, use lists a lot
in the examples in lectures and exercises.

00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,129
So far, most of our examples have
been with the CodeWorld library.

00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:07,970
So, you got to know the Picture type
and all kinds of operations on it.

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,600
And similarly, the next material will be
mostly about lists and functions working

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,840
on lists.

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,090
So, there we have two somewhat opposite cases.

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,319
In some sense, the Picture type is not abstract
because you can actually draw it and see a

00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,230
lot about what your code does, but it is abstract
in the sense that you don't really have operations

00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,270
to look inside the Picture.

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,870
So, all of the operations that
you have done are *on* Pictures.

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,710
You never looked *inside* a Picture.

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,480
With lists, it's the opposite.

00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,320
For lists, we will look at several ways of
doing case distinction and looking into the

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,420
inside of lists.

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:57,950
Because they are one of the basic destructible
types in Haskell, differently from the Picture

00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,850
type.

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,470
Why this focus on lists?

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,580
Not because lists are always
the best data structure.

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,070
They certainly aren't so often, in particular
once you write more real-world code.

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,880
There are more appropriate data structure
choices for doing something in Haskell.

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,100
And to some extent, you will also
see how to define your own datatypes.

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,770
But that's not what we will start with.

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,900
We will start now with lists, because they
are already existing; they have syntactic

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,200
support like list comprehensions,
but also other functions.

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,210
So, mostly for didactic reasons, to be able
to write examples quickly, we will work with

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,210
lists.

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,000
Not because you should always use lists.

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,810
That's an important other lesson
that I want to make upfront.

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,130
There is a lot of list support in Haskell.

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,460
You see this already with the special
syntax like list comprehensions.

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,470
In some sense, this is partly
due to historical precedents.

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,700
I mentioned, I think in the first lecture,
Lisp as an ancient functional language.

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,890
So, in some sense, it could be seen as a predecessor
of Haskell, even though there are a lot of differences.

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,950
The name Lisp comes from "list processor".

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,690
So, there, lists were all and everything.

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:26,000
Even Haskell also has a lot of support for
list processing, despite my previous comments

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,380
that, in fact, you should often
use other data structures.

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,340
I already mentioned that there is special
syntactic support, which is also helpful for

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,290
our example considerations.

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,570
It is not true for all other data structures.

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:49,600
Another thing that I want to repeat
is: Haskell lists are homogeneous.

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,730
That is different from Lisp.

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,710
In Lisp, you could put everything in the same
list, whereas in Haskell, lists are homogeneous.

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,530
What this means is that you can't have
different types of elements in the same list.

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,160
You can have a list of characters, you can
have a list of strings, you can have a list

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,390
of numbers, you can have a list of pairs of
strings and characters; but you can't have

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,770
a list where different kinds of values are
mixed.

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,910
There are other data structures
which allow this, but not lists.

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,610
So, this must always be in the back of
your mind when you think, for example,

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:27,330
about the functions I'm going to show you.

75 # slide
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,750
Let me talk you through a few functions
from the standard library on lists.

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:39,450
In some sense, these could be seen as a small
domain-specific language of functions on lists.

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,100
It is a domain-specific language on lists.

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,860
And to a good extent, they are accessor functions,
so: getting something out of a list; exactly

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,060
the kind of functions that
you don't have for Pictures.

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,450
Because for Pictures, you could only construct
new Pictures; you couldn't take a Picture

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,840
apart.

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,460
I won't introduce these functions by showing
the definitions or explaining the semantics

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,730
in some mathematical sense.

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,040
I will simply give examples and the names
of the functions, and then these examples

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,450
should be clear enough to tell
you what the function is doing.

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,820
So, henceforth, you can use these functions
in writing your exercise task submissions.

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,200
So, what do we have?

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,080
For example, we have a function
to access a prefix of a list.

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,900
So, let's say we have a
list of the values 1 to 10.

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,440
We want to take the first three elements.

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,831
We can simply say "take 3 of this list".

00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:36,020
And what we get is exactly
what you see here on the right.

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:42,840
I will always show, to the left, an expression
on lists (using some of the list functions),

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,280
and on the right you will then see what this
evaluates to (if you, for example, were to

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,740
put this expression into the
Haskell interpreter GHCi).

00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,620
So, you can take a prefix.

00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,010
You can drop a prefix.

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,830
If you drop the first three elements from
1 to 10, then you get the list consisting

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,970
of all the elements from 4 to 10.

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,570
Not surprising.

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,110
And you can check whether a list is empty.

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,140
So, this is the 'null' function.

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,880
You might also consider it to be "isNull",
but actually the name is just 'null'.

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,500
So, we give it the list.

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,910
And if you give it the empty
list, then it returns True.

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,580
And if you give it a non-empty list, for example
a non-empty string (which we know is just

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:35,100
a list of characters), then the output will
be False, because this is not an empty list.

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,490
Generally, not just checking being empty or
not, you can compute the length of a list.

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,910
This is also unsurprising.

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,460
Given a list, it gives you the number of elements
in the list; in this case, the number of characters,

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,340
of course not just the number of unique elements.

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,450
So, if you have five 'a's,
it will also give you 5.

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,960
It won't count how many
different elements occurred.

00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,990
It will simply say how long the list is.

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,760
So, in this case, the answer is 5.

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,970
You can access the first element of a list.

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,750
It is a bit similar to "take 1", but "take
1" would return the outcome as a list.

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,250
So, "take 1" of this list would be the singleton
list containing 1 (like this: [1]), whereas

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,420
"head [1..10]" is just 1 (like this: 1).

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,510
Or, in the case of a String, head "abcde"
is not a String consisting of the letter 'a'

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,200
(like this: "a"), but the character 'a' (like this: 'a').
(Attention: 'a' is a Char, "a" is a String, that is [Char].)

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:34,350
Because this String is a list of characters,
and this is the first character in there.

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,530
You can also access the last element.

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:44,440
Then again, in this case, last [1..10] would
be the number 10, and last "abcde" is the

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,510
character 'e'.

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,950
Then you can take the "tail" of a list.

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,180
So, "head" means you get the first element
of the list, and "tail" means you get all

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
the rest.

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,170
So, if you take the first element
away, what remains is the list "bcde".

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:08,520
Also, we could apply "tail" to
[1..10] and we would get [2..10].

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,690
In that sense, "tail" corresponds to "head".

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,270
It gives you what is left over
if you take the head away.

00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,140
And something similar exists for "last".

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,890
So, "last" gives the last element in the list.

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,870
And "init" gives the list
without that last element.

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,230
So, here, "last" gave 'e',
and "init" gives "abcd".

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,470
Of course, these are lists
and not just characters.

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,770
Here, we get a character because it is one
element from the list, but "tail" and "init"

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,220
always have to return lists.

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,840
So, in this case, it is a
list of characters, a String.

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:46,870
Then there are more fancy ways of splitting
a list, and not just into its head and rest,

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,970
or last and whatever comes before
that, but at some arbitrary point.

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,270
So, you could say, I have a String / list
and I want to split it at some point.

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,170
And then this means that you take as many
elements from the front of the list as the

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,170
number says.

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,900
So, in this case, "abc", and the
rest is put into a second result.

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,810
So, in some sense, you could see this
as a combination of "take" and "drop".

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:19,800
You get "take 3" and you get "drop 3", but
both are returned by one function rather than

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,840
having two different functions for doing this.

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,310
Then there is the infamous index access.

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:33,300
So, you can, in Haskell, with this operator
'!!', access an element at a certain index.

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
Counting starts with 0.

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,080
But as I already said before, such access-by-index
is almost forbidden in code that you write

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,640
in your exercises.

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,580
So, usually, you are supposed to write
your code without using the index operator.

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,040
Simply because in Haskell it is
a very bad habit to use this.

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,560
Usually, there is a better way.

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,720
Then there are other operations that work
on a list as a whole rather than accessing

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,030
parts of it.

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,630
For example, the 'reverse' function is useful.

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,660
It takes a list and gives it
back in the opposite order.

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,020
So, for a String, it simply creates the
String as if you were reading it backward.

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,060
I think this is very natural.

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,800
The reverse of the empty list is the empty
list.

00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,750
The reverse of the empty String
is the empty String, of course.

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,880
Then, you can combine lists
or Strings (using '++').

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,770
Here again written for Strings, but it
also works on other types of lists.

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,650
But both, of course, have to
be the same kind of lists.

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,860
So, you cannot concatenate the
String "abc" and the list [1..10].

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,580
But you could concatenate
these two lists, for example.

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,490
And what does it do?

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,750
It returns the combined list or string.

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,950
Then, there are other ways to combine two
lists.

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,330
For example, you can "zip" two lists.

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,010
That means that they are not concatenated
(one after the other), but actually, they

00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,310
are pairwise combined.

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:03,310
So, in this case, zipping the String "abc"
and the String "def" gives a list of pairs,

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,820
where the first character from the first list
and the first character from the second list

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
are combined.

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:15,480
So, 'a' and 'd', then the second element of
the first argument and the second element

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,040
of the second argument, ('b','e'), and so
on.

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,701
If one of the two lists is shorter
than the other, then this stops early.

00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:30,040
It stops at the point where one of
the two lists has no further elements.

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,270
And there is a version of ++
to work with nested lists.

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,420
So, this concatenation (++) takes
two lists and concatenates them.

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,420
But sometimes you have the case where you want
to have more than two lists and concatenate

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
all of them.

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,630
Then you can use the 'concat' function.

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,940
It takes a list of lists (it could also be
a list of Strings), and it concatenates all

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,020
the inner lists.

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,010
So, in some sense, it puts the "++" operation
in between all these places where previously

00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,250
there was a comma.

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,130
So, this gives you [1,2] ++ [] ++ [3].

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:11,030
And the empty list doesn't contribute to
the concatenation, so in this case you would

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,649
get the output list [1,2,3].

00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:18,990
And with these functions, you can
already write quite a bit of code.

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,250
In particular, in the beginning, you could
use the test for emptiness ("null"), accessing

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:31,810
the head ("head"), and the tail of a list or a
String ("tail"), to write code that recursively

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,810
destructs a list.

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,460
I know that some of you already know about
pattern-matching, because we have seen this

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,070
in the exercise submissions.

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:43,280
But actually, until the point where we introduce
pattern-matching in the lecture, you can assume

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,740
that all the exercise tasks that you write
have a solution without pattern-matching.

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,860
So, if you use pattern-matching, that is not
forbidden, unless it is actually prevented

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
by Autotool.

00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:00,020
But in any case, as long as we haven't handled
pattern-matching in the lecture, you can assume

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:07,530
that the exercise tasks have solutions that
are intended to be without pattern-matching.

76 # slide
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:15,280
We now have different choices
when we write a list function.

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,620
For example, we can decide whether we will
work by case distinction and recursion or

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,340
by just combining some of these functions
we have just seen, or possibly using list

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,340
comprehensions.

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,850
So, let me discuss this on an
example from a previous exercise.

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,830
There, the task was to decide whether
a certain String was a palindrome.

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,150
The predicate is-a-palindrome?

00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:48,300
And one way to think about this is to first
consider that a palindrome is certainly present

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:56,150
if you have a very short String that
just contains zero or one element.

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,620
So, checking the length of this String (which
is possible because Strings are lists), checking

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,460
whether it is smaller than 2.

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,840
And if so, then return True, because then
the String is certainly a palindrome.

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,910
And if it isn't that short, then either by
pattern-matching (which I just said, I won't

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,770
show yet) or by using the 'head' and 'last'
functions, so checking whether the first element and

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:23,780
the last element of this String are the same
character, and if so, then also check whether

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,300
if you remove these first and last elements
(which you could do with "init" and "tail"),

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,050
then the remainder is also a palindrome.

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,740
So, certainly, this is a valid definition for
checking whether a String is a palindrome.

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,430
It doesn't use indexing.

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:47,490
It is not a very idiomatic solution for this,
but actually at least avoids using list indexing

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,730
(which one could also use
when solving this task).

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,081
But actually, it is worthwhile to think whether,
with some of the existing functions, we can

00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,760
express this predicate/property much simpler.

00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,150
And indeed, we can.

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,790
We can simply write something like this.

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:07,190
We can say, which is much more declarative,
that a String is a palindrome if it is the

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,620
case that reversing it doesn't change it.

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,300
Well, actually reversing a String doesn't
ever "change" it, it just returns another

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,870
String which is the reverse
of the original String.

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,850
But then we can check whether the reverse
of the String is equal to the String itself.

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,440
That is a definition of "isPalindrome".

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,140
And it is certainly preferable
to the definition seen up here.

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,530
You might think that the first version is
more efficient, because here you have to first

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,940
reverse the String, which is
certainly an expensive computation.

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,560
But actually, you don't know.

00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,730
Most of you probably don't have a very clear
picture of the cost model of Haskell yet.

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,760
So, you shouldn't work from such preconceptions.

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,040
Try, in the exercise tasks, to go for the
elegant and expressive version, and not the

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,980
one for which you think (with some imperative
programming mindset) that this must be the

00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,460
more efficient version.

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,440
You cannot really tell at
the moment, I would say.

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,930
So, try to think in the spirit of this task.

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:19,660
Here, I would clearly have preferred
this submission to the above one.

77 # slide
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:26,380
Maybe a somewhat surprising observation is
that in Haskell we can even work with infinite

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,380
lists.

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,880
So, there are expressions and values
that represent infinite lists.

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,930
For example, what you see here.

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:39,860
We have seen something similar before, where we
used some expression like [1..10] or [1,3..9],

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:46,309
where we got all odd numbers from 1 to 9.

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,220
You can actually leave out the upper
bound, and simply say you want [1,3..].

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,730
Then you will mathematically get (conceptually,
at least) the list of all the odd numbers.

00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,730
An infinite list!

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,170
Even though you cannot write it down, in an
explicit list form, you can write it down

00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,170
as an expression.

00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:11,280
And this semantically means the
infinite list of all odd numbers.

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,800
Now, what can you do with such a list?

00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,120
Of course, you cannot print it.

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,260
But you can work with it.

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,690
For example, you can define
other lists in terms of it.

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,950
So, you could, for example, say: I want to
have the square numbers of everything from

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,950
such a list.

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:36,450
You could have [1,3..], or you can have just
[1..] (which is the infinite list of all natural

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:42,520
numbers), and this list comprehension as a
whole is the infinite list of all squares

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
of all natural numbers.

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,280
We get all the square numbers.

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,810
You cannot print this out, but it
is defined and you can work with it.

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,810
How can you work with it?

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,000
At least, you can work with prefixes of it.

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,231
So, we can define this as an expression, which
stands for an infinite list, and then you

00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:03,640
might decide that you want to look at only
a part of it (after having it defined as a

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,620
whole infinite list).

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:13,150
For example, you can say something like: Give
me the first three elements of the list of

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,480
all square numbers.

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,180
And this means that you don't have to build,
somehow, this upper bound into this list.

00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,120
Maybe you don't know, when you define the
square numbers, how many of them you will

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
need.

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,850
So, you define them as an infinite list.

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,040
But then, at a certain usage point,
you say: Give me the first three.

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,640
And then you really get the first three,
and the other ones won't even be computed.

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,740
So, the functionality here is not that Haskell
will try to compute this infinite list of

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,880
all the square numbers and then realize
that that is not something it can do.

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
No.

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,140
Instead, what will happen is that Haskell will
work out that it will only need the first

00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,620
three of these elements.

00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,380
So, it will actually only compute [1,4,9].

00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,290
And this works in general.

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:07,260
It is not restricted to this idea, to take
a fixed number of elements, where you maybe

00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,960
could say this is a special case that this
number is somehow used to decide how far to

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
go.

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,600
No, this works for almost all the list functions.

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,210
You cannot reverse an infinite
list; that doesn't make sense.

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,960
You also can't get the last
element of an infinite list.

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,370
And some uses of recursion are also problematic.

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,700
But many of the list functions that you have
already seen, and also further ones, operate

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,720
(without any problems) on infinite lists,
provided that the output is something that

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,450
requires only finite computation.

00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,020
For example, you could say something like:
I want to zip the infinite list of all the

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,260
natural numbers including zero
([0..]) and the finite String "ab".

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,260
What would you get?

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,580
As I said about the 'zip' function:

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,830
It stops when one of the two
lists has no further elements.

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,080
So, in this case, this finite list
is the one which will stop first.

00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,760
It contains only 'a' and 'b'.

00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,250
So, from this infinite list of all non-negative
numbers, only the 0 and the 1 will be consumed,

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,620
and the rest will never be computed.

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,760
And this is not a special
case on the first argument.

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,760
If you switch the two arguments
here, it will also work.

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,170
That is because of the
feature of "lazy evaluation".

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,130
It was something that I mentioned in the first
video today, where I talked about avoiding

00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,940
the computation of the Ackermann function,
where I said that Haskell will only compute

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,770
the things that it absolutely needs.

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:31,030
In this case, the remainder list of this after
the first 0 and 1 is not needed, so it will

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:35,190
never be computed.

00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:42,190
Okay.

78 # slide
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,060
This does not mean that some magic is going
on.

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,980
So, Haskell does not solve
arbitrary mathematical problems.

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:54,610
Let's consider this example here, where
we have the list of all square numbers.

00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:01,210
Which is an infinite list, because we do this
for all numbers from 1 and so on, ad infinitum.

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,210
And then, what do we want?

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,070
We want to compute the result list of all
the m from this infinite list such that m

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,309
is smaller than 100.

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:14,210
You might expect that this computes exactly
the list of square numbers in [1..81] and

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,520
then it stops.

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,960
Actually, that is not what is going to happen.

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,520
What is going to happen is that this evaluation
will hang after producing a finite prefix.

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,380
So, it will produce these square numbers from
1 to 81, and then it will go on and on and

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,400
on forever.

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,980
Why is that?

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:41,760
Because Haskell doesn't use knowledge or algebraic
proving to deduce that, actually, since this

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,650
list is increasing, and we square the numbers,
this will also be an increasing list, so once

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,390
we have seen the 100, we cannot
ever again see a *smaller* number.

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:56,500
That would be possible for this very specific
expression, but in general, you could have

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:04,010
a list in here which, after a million numbers,
again gives something which is smaller than

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,010
100.

00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,910
And then, this should go into the output list.

00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:12,420
So, it is very specific that for the
square numbers, they are ever-increasing.

00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,130
But Haskell shouldn't use this knowledge,
because basically, this would defy "referential

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,130
transparency".

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,300
What was this again?

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,140
The idea was that if you have some expression,
then it should be interchangeable with any

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,320
other expression which computes the same values
(the same value - or the same values, in the

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,800
case of a list).

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:38,470
So, while from this specific expression we
might see that once we have seen "100", we

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,950
won't ever see a smaller number again, let's
say that this is some other expression which

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,080
also computes the square
numbers, but in some other way.

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,620
In some, maybe, less obvious way.

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,670
So that Haskell, or any other computer program,
cannot in general prove that what is computed

00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,390
here are the square numbers.

00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,050
So, it shouldn't make any assumptions about
that.

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,500
Put the other way around:

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,700
This expression and any other expression that
also computes the square numbers should be

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,290
interchangeable here.

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,670
And simply the fact that, from this specific
expression, we can see that it is the square

00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:18,450
numbers does not mean that this is possible
for any or every other expression that happens

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,660
to give us the same list.

00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,130
But the two programs
shouldn't behave differently.

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,630
So, the only way to make sure that is the
case is that also in this case Haskell will

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,610
actually try out all the numbers
that come from this list.

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,860
And since it cannot try them all out in a
finite time, it will not produce a finite

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
list here.

00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,730
So, this is completely different
from the case where we had "take 3".

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:50,390
Because there, the 3 really allows Haskell,
the runtime system, the evaluation of the

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,120
program to know when it is done.

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,960
It does not depend on the elements in the
list.

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,110
So, this is a cautionary example that you
shouldn't expect some mathematical magic.

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,980
Everything is driven by lazy evaluation.

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,710
By this principle (lazy evaluation), Haskell
uses case distinction to know what to do,

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:17,170
and evaluates only arguments that are
needed to make these case distinctions.

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:25,370
And this often allows us to get finite computations
involving infinite data, but it is not a mathematical

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:36,290
magical mystery solver.

79 # slide
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,600
To finish up for today, I
want to discuss this example.

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,880
This is, as the name
suggests, a sorting function.

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,990
And actually, it is essentially
implementing the idea of Quicksort.

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,150
So, you see some of the features in
action that we have introduced so far.

00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:03,790
We have case distinction: so, saying that
the empty list is sorted to the empty list.

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,980
And otherwise, we perform some local computation.

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:16,179
So, we choose a pivot element and use list
comprehensions to, basically, split our input

00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:18,270
list into smaller and greater values.

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,650
And then, we have recursive calls on
these "smaller" and "greater" elements.

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:28,190
And then, we combine the results with this
concatenation function that you have also

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,559
already seen.

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,020
And in the end, we hopefully get a sorted
list.

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,210
I want to discuss this, but actually I want
to see some aspects that are better explained

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,890
in an editor, where we also
see the program running.

00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,909
So, actually, I will make a
separate video for this part.
