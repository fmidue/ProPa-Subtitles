00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome back to another week of ProPa.

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,280
This week we will talk about types again,
but not polymorphic types, not higher-order

00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,410
types, at least not in focus.

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,519
Instead, we will talk about new type
constructs called algebraic datatypes.

00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,689
Actually, they can also be combined with
polymorphism and have interesting higher-order uses.

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,780
But at least for this first video, we will
concentrate on very simple algebraic data

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,030
types: first, simple enumeration types, and
then non-recursive algebraic datatypes, and

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,730
probably also not yet considering polymorphism.

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,110
These more interesting / complex constructs
and interactions with polymorphism and maybe

00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:57,070
higher-order will be the topic
of later videos also this week.

125 # slide
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:03,019
So, what kinds of types have we seen so far?

00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:10,070
On the one hand, of course, we have dealt
with things like simple base types like number

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,140
types or Booleans and characters.

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,110
So, things that are built into the language,
and from which other types can be constructed.

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,650
And in particular, we looked at list and tuple
constructions which were used to make compound

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,380
types: lists of pairs of integers
and floats, and things like that.

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,240
Of course, there were type variables as of
last week when we looked at polymorphism.

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,040
But ultimately, these type variables would
also be replaced by types we have already

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,119
seen, like integers or characters
or lists of those, etc.

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,479
Then, of course, there are function types
that we know now from the higher-order part

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,840
of the lecture, that we can have functions
that

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,230
take functions as arguments, for example.

00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,259
Then we have the function arrow also
occurring in types and parts of types.

00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:03,829
But ultimately, the things that are between
the function arrows, so far, would have been

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:11,570
base types like these, or compound
types made from these, mainly.

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,580
Also remember that when I introduced lists,
I already said that, ultimately, we don't

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,260
want to build all of our structures from lists.

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,450
Because while nice for examples in a lecture
like this, ultimately, in reality, lists are

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,470
not always the best structure for keeping
things in a compound setting, for example.

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,120
To combine things, you can use lists sometimes,
but you should not always use a list, so there

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
must be something else as well.

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,860
Just as we have other
datatypes in other languages.

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,070
We haven't just seen the types that
are mentioned in this first point.

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:52,300
For example, in the case of the CodeWorld
library (on the CodeWorld website), we have

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,990
also seen that there can be domain-specific
types like this Picture type, which is clearly

00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,520
not something that is built into the
language like integers and floats are.

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,270
It was something that we used (that was given
to us from the library), but it is probably

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,450
something that somebody has defined in the
language rather than it already being provided

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,570
by the language itself, by the
compiler or something like that.

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:22,030
That's ultimately what we want to do when we
create a lot of projects, that we can define

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,060
our own types.

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,780
And the library does this for this Picture
type.

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,790
It is like in an object-oriented language, where
you define your own class that is relevant

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,760
to your domain, and then Picture could be a
class and has objects and methods that operate

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,090
on these objects.

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,510
And the situation is similar here, except
that we don't have classes in the sense of

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,510
object-oriented programming.

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,510
We have types.

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,010
And Picture is a type.

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,500
And we have values of that type.

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,140
And we have functions that
operate on values of that type.

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:55,970
Now, the Picture type itself is not
something that we will define in the lecture.

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,710
It could be defined with algebraic datatypes,
but that is not something we are going to

00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,710
do.

00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,950
Because for our purposes and uses of CodeWorld,
it is sufficient if we simply have Picture

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,950
as an abstract type.

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,650
So, we know that it exists.

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,870
We know the operations on it.

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,550
We don't want to define our own Picture type.

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:20,820
But if we wanted to do that, or do something
similar for another domain than vector graphics,

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,400
then we would use algebraic datatypes.

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:35,550
So, that's the way to go beyond these base
types and predetermined combinations of them

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,660
with constructs like lists and pairs.

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,070
Now, what are these algebraic datatypes?

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,740
Also, in what sense are they algebraic?

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,770
That sounds a bit mathematical.

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,980
And we are not going to discuss
the mathematics behind that.

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:54,530
But I still hope that it will become apparent
what is algebraic about these, once we see

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,530
some signatures.

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,150
From a first approximation point of view,
we could say that algebraic datatypes are

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,510
something which you might have seen
in other languages in some form.

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:12,210
For example, they can be seen as more general
(and also more stringent, more statically

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:19,400
safe) versions of what is either known as
enumeration or union types (in very simple

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,530
forms of algebraic datatypes).

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:29,070
But actually, modern languages like Swift have
features like *recursive* enum types, which

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:36,300
are really a far way apart from simple
enumeration types in C, for example.

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,770
And these (recursive enum types) are already
something similar to algebraic datatypes.

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:48,840
And again, the transfer here is not that algebraic
datatypes are what Swift has and then made

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
more general.

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,090
It is actually the other way around.

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,150
Algebraic datatypes have been around for
a long time in functional languages.

00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:02,450
And then Swift and other modern mainstream
languages have taken inspiration from that.

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,930
And ultimately, I would say that algebraic
datatypes are still the nicer version of

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,080
this, whereas the recursive enum types in
Swift are similar but have made some pragmatic

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
compromises.

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,960
So, they are not at the same, let's say,
mathematical level as algebraic datatypes.

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:28,830
But for users, for you, when using these,
that won't shine through too much, I think.

126 # slide
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,770
So, let us start very simply indeed.

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,870
Assume we want to be able to
talk about days of the week.

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,700
So, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,640
And on this data, we want to compute things
like: this is a workday, yes or no, or some

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:52,110
other determination of what
properties a certain day has.

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,150
How would we currently do this?

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,680
How would we maybe do this in other languages?

00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,580
How would we do it in Haskell?

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,060
Typically, we could say: we fix some encoding
of the weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) as

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
numbers.

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,600
And of course, there are some natural choices.

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,080
For example, we could say: Monday is the
first day, Tuesday is the second day, etc.

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,650
So, we would use the numbers from
1 to 7 to encode Monday to Sunday.

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,381
And then if we want to write functions that
express whether a day is a workday or some

00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,970
other properties, then we could
write a function like this here.

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,100
So, workday goes from Integer to Bool.

00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,510
It is a predicate on integers
interpreted as days of the week.

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,520
And we want to know whether a day is a workday.

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,920
Then of course we could say: we simply
compare the number code of that day versus 6.

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:48,199
The 6 means Saturday, so everything smaller
is a day from Monday to Friday, so is a work

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,199
day.

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,170
That is, of course, possible.

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,360
We are somewhat lucky in that case.

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,050
The function is so simple that it is simply a
comparison because the property we are interested

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,210
in here really corresponds to a number range,
in this case, 1 to 5, whereas the opposite

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,950
would be 6 to 7.

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,550
So, if we have a property as simple as this
one, where you can really compute the thing

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,360
that you want to know by comparing numbers
against numbers, then this becomes a very

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
simple function.

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,520
But of course, it need not always be so
simple if you want to compute something

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,160
with days.

127 # slide
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:32,210
For example, we might want to compute on which
days of the week there is an exercise session

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,210
in this course.

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,580
Of course, in this semester, this is maybe
not such a useful question because we don't

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,540
have the actual exercise sessions.

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,750
Actually, this is taken from last year's
slides, where that made more sense.

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:53,950
But it's still a reasonable thing: to want in
general to have some property on our weekdays

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,240
that has this form.

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,230
So, selecting certain days of the week that
have the property of “that is when an exercise

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,270
session takes place” (or
something else takes place).

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,990
Okay now, this time the answer is not as simple…
the program is not as simple as doing a comparison

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,460
like: is d smaller than 6
from the previous slide.

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Why not?

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,290
Because there is not a consecutive range of
days where we have exercises and where we

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,290
don't.

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,980
So, for example, one way to
compute this property is…

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,990
(I think this is from the data from last year,
so, when there were actually exercise sessions

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,990
last year.

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,560
And probably the same plan would have applied
this year if we had an actual presence-course).

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,770
So, something can be expressed here
like: 3 is not an exercise day.

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,950
It corresponds to Wednesday.

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,740
And the weekend didn't have
exercises last year either.

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,880
So, we could say: on Wednesday, Saturday,
and Sunday, we don't have exercises.

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,970
And on all other dates, we do have exercises.

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,750
We have this catch-all case ('_') here.

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,310
Of course, this is something that we can write.

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,000
It is not very readable, maybe.

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,839
So, already takes some thinking:
what is this 3 actually?

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,520
Why do we say which are the False cases,
and then we have a catch-all case for True?

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,760
Why don't we have it the other way around?

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,430
Also, we can make off-by-one errors again.

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:22,470
So, if I am not sure how my encoding works:
depending on whether I start counting Monday

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,510
at 1 or at 0, I could easily
misinterpret what is happening here.

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,330
But of course, if I have fixed encoding
like: Monday starts on 1, etc., then that's

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,380
a way to implement the property.

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:44,391
We could also want to/try to make this seemingly
more efficient by saying something like: Maybe

00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:48,460
I can still make a comparison by
first excluding all the weekend days.

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,520
Maybe I can use a guard to say: if the day
is more than 6, or if it is greater than 5,

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,980
then it is definitely not an exercise day.

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,170
So, I could actually write
different definitions here.

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,860
But it is not clear that working with these
comparisons and numbers would truly lead to

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,500
a nice way of expressing this function.

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:15,339
Plus, another danger in having this type 'Integer
→ Bool' because Integer is a much bigger

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,279
type than just 1 to 7 which I
want to use for my weekdays.

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,970
So, assume I have a function like this…
actually the function from the previous slide.

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,730
The question is: what happens if I call the
'exerciseDay' function with an input like

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,790
12?

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,200
I can do this because 12 is an Integer.

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,649
Then, of course, the question
is: What does it do?

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:42,680
It computes something like: in the 'workday'
from the previous slide, it would compute

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,220
False because the comparison was 'd < 6', so,
for some reason, the 12th day of the week,

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,590
which doesn't even exist, is not a workday.

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:58,860
Whereas for this 'exerciseDay' function as written
here, for the input 12, it would say: it is

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,610
an exercise day, for whatever reason.

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,820
That reason is: it would run
into this catch-all case here.

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,290
It would return True, but this doesn't
have a meaningful interpretation.

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,190
And actually, if I tried to rewrite this function
in some other way, maybe matching on the exercise

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,950
days, instead of having a catch-all case, or
do that for False, then suddenly, the 12th

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,149
day of the week would not be an exercise
day.

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,610
So, it doesn't really make sense
from the weekdays' point of view.

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:34,220
So, days don't have this property that there
is a 12th weekday or something like that.

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:41,399
There is something fishy going on here, and
it has to do with this naïve encoding/usage

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,149
of numbers for weekdays.

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,390
That is not very abstract.

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,880
It is too low-level.

128 # slide
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,030
So, what is an alternative?

00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:01,360
For example, in Haskell, we can define something
like this, which introduces new values of a

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
new type.

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,580
So, what we say here is: we introduce a datatype.

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,310
It gets a name Day.

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,140
So, not that it's something like Picture, something
that we can use in other types as arguments

00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,740
or results of functions.

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,570
And then we also introduce what
values this new type Day has.

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:26,600
And it has the new values: Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, etc., up to Sunday.

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,180
And then we can use these new constants in
computations, as return values of functions,

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
etc.

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,250
Now, at first sight, it looks like
a union type or an enumeration type.

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,480
Even something like C has this.

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,910
The difference is, for example, that enumeration
types in C work by really introducing named

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,910
constants.

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,430
So, if we do something like this with the
syntax that C allows for enumeration types,

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,450
then we are actually back at the same
approach as on the previous slides.

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:06,280
Then, basically, Day would just be a different
/ a disguise name for Integers or some other

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,339
base type, and Monday would
be a constant (0 or 1).

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,380
So, it would again depend on whether
C decides to count the things.

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,100
It might start counting from 0 or 1, but actually,
ultimately, you would simply introduce new

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,040
named constants which are Integer constants.

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,640
They would have these names, but under the hood,
they would still be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or something

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,820
like that.

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,831
This is not what happens here.

00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:32,779
What happens here is really that the type
that is introduced by this definition is a

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,589
completely new type that is separate
from all other types in the language.

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,420
So, it is not an Integer type,
or renaming of the Integer type.

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,050
It is really something completely new, and
the compiler will now allow, for example,

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,500
to use these constants as numbers
because they are not numbers.

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,300
They are new values of the new type
which was introduced in this declaration.

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,380
So, they are completely separate from anything
else already existing in the language or in

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,380
the user's code.

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,399
And then, how would we compute on this?

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,470
For example, now, our 'exerciseDay'
function could look like this.

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,780
It would, of course, not anymore go from Integer
to Bool, but from this new type Day to Bool.

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,820
So, that's why we use the type name here.

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,850
So, what's on the left of this
equal sign here is the type name.

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,100
And on the right, we have the values' names.

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,550
So, Day can occur here as a type
name, and then we have a property.

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,950
So, we return Bool.

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:34,029
And when we give our definition of the function,
we don't mention here 2 or 3 or 6 or 7,

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,579
or something like that, but we actually mention
the constants that we introduced for this

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:39,579
new type.

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,110
So, exerciseDay Wednesday is False.

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,339
Saturday is False.

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,570
Sunday is False.

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,570
Everything else is True.

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,360
Of course, a question here
is: What is everything else?

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,209
Well, everything else is exactly the four
values that are mentioned here, which are

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,230
not covered in the previous three slides.

00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:01,140
So, there is nothing like 12th weekday in
this interpretation here because there is

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,260
no 8th, 9th, or 10th value here.

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,279
These are not Integers.

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,680
These are not somehow just indices.

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,770
No, we have exactly seven values
of this type as introduced here.

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:20,660
And everything that could go into this anonymous
place here would be the ones that haven't

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,839
been covered here.

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,250
So, it is illegal, simply, from the compiler's
perspective already to pass anything else

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,899
here than one of these seven days.

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,890
Of course, someone would say:
we lose some opportunities.

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,760
So, for example, now we cannot
compute with numbers anymore.

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,950
So, if you want to introduce the weekend day…

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:49,920
So, if you want to check with the workday
function whether it is a workday, now we can't

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,120
compute something like: give me the day, and
then I compare whether it is smaller than

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
6.

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,990
That doesn't make sense because
these are not numbers anymore.

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,230
We lose some tricks that we can do with enum
types in C, for example, knowing that they

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,279
are ultimately just numbers, but
these tricks are simply tricks.

00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,749
They are not a well-maintainable
way of programming.

00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,669
So, I wouldn't even call this
a benefit that we lose here.

00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:19,640
It is simply more declarative and clearer
that these are new values of a new type, and

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,890
we cannot compute with them by '+'
or '-' or '<', etc. because weekdays

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,069
don't work that way.

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:32,869
They are not numbers, so we shouldn't treat them
as numbers as a less strictly typed language

00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,210
does.

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,809
Then there is another issue or concern
that introduces itself at this point.

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,789
So, you might think: the C approach
must be much more efficient.

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:48,049
Simple encoding these things as numbers, and then
computing with numbers is, of course, certainly

00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:52,889
much more efficient than this approach where
we introduce these new Strings and then compare

00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:53,889
them.

00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,759
Does this mean that I have to compare two
Strings of length 'a' or something like

00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,539
that, instead of simply comparing
something with the number 6?

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,539
Well… no.

00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,980
This is just what's on the
surface of this language.

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,070
This is not what happens in the implementation.

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,830
You need not worry that somehow these will
be stored as Strings, and then at runtime,

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,159
some of these Strings will be compared
against some of these or things like that.

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,919
Of course, the compiler makes a
more efficient code from this.

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,289
So, under the hood, it is
not a String comparison.

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:29,609
That also means that you don't even need
to try to make your value names short here

00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,619
in the hope that this makes
the program more efficient.

00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,809
That's complete nonsense.

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,019
We have to be taught that
this is not how this works.

00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:42,840
This is something that the compiler and the
programmer see (these names), but the machine

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,639
will never see these names
ultimately in the compiled code.

00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,679
Under the hood, this will be turned into something
that resembles the C way, where these are

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,710
numbers in some sense.

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,350
But that is not something that the programmer
has to deal with, or the programmer should

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,629
even be aware of because that
would only need to abuse.

00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:09,359
That is something to bear in mind that these are
not Strings and there is no String comparison

00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,220
going on.

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:21,980
And another thing that should be kept in mind,
namely, that these are different entities.

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,609
So, what appears on the left of such a
definition here does not appear on the right.

00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:33,210
They are completely different things, also
in terms of their role in the language.

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,519
So, what appears on the left here
is called a type constructor.

00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,490
We construct a new type when we
introduce a definition like that.

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,690
And what we have on the right
are called data constructors.

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,049
They construct data; they construct values
which have a type, in this case, the type that

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,049
is constructed here.

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,859
So, they are different entities:
type constructors, data constructors.

00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,539
They happen to live in different name spaces.

00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:05,570
So, there is no confusion if you use the same
identifier for the type constructor and the

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,570
data constructor.

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,990
So, they have to be uppercase,
as we already see here.

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,370
So, these identifiers must be uppercase.

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,830
That distinguishes them from, for example,
function names, which must be lowercase.

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:21,989
But in theory, you could use the same uppercase
identifier both as a type name and a value

00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:22,989
name.

00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:27,330
It is not usually recommended to do that
unless there are special reasons to do it.

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:34,630
We will refrain from doing it in the lecture,
but you should be aware that, in theory, the

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:42,229
same name could be used here and here, or
even here as a name of a data constructor

00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:43,450
in another type.

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,320
That, of course, can lead to confusion.

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,029
We are not going to do this usually, but the
compiler will not complain about this because

00:20:54,029 --> 00:21:04,499
it is valid in the language to use the same
identifier in such a place and in such a place.

129 # slide
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:11,210
On the previous slide, I mentioned this example
with the 12th day which is, of course, observed

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:19,940
as a weekday, and thanks to the introduction of
this new type, this absurd input was excluded.

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,889
That was a nice static guarantee.

00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:29,460
And actually, there are more benefits of using
this explicit type approach instead of simply

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
number codes.

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,940
For example, we also get more
exhaustiveness and redundancy checking.

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,999
That is something that we talked about when
we talked about case distinction in Haskell

00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:40,999
code.

00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:47,720
So, let's actually think about this based on
the level example that we had in the exercises.

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,360
Remember, there was this function.

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,379
It was interpreted as a description of a level.

00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,960
So, given some coordinates,
it returned an integer.

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,220
And this integer code was seen
as block, water, pearl, etc.

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:09,789
We have this 'aTile' function which maps
these number codes to actual Pictures.

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,889
Of course, this already has some danger.

00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,360
We can easily confuse things here.

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,229
So, if somebody writes the 'level' function,
it might not always be clear; they might

00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:22,299
not always have in mind what
exactly stands for what.

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,330
Sometimes they may write 3 instead of 2
because 2 and 3 are just some numbers.

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,450
They are not really nice
declarative names for things.

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,019
'level' doesn't have a '2'.

00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,539
'level' has 'water' or 'pearl'
or whatever.

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:40,950
So, in that sense already, this is a bit unfortunate,
what we have done so far; it corresponds to

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,859
representing weekdays by 1,2,3,…

00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:48,429
Of course, at this point you could already
imagine that it would probably be a good idea

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:53,169
to also use an enumeration type
here, similarly to weekdays.

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:59,359
But actually, there is some further cause
for worry in a function like this, namely,

00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,359
extensibility.

00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,830
So, let's assume that we want
to make our levels richer.

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:11,269
We have some new idea for our game, and we
introduce a new kind of tile, maybe a spike,

00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:12,659
that can be somewhere.

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,710
So, we will start using the value 5 for
this because 5 doesn't seem to be used yet.

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:23,210
So, now we write level functions where at
some place it will return a 5 which we intend

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,260
to stand for Spike, but actually, we
forget to add this extra case in the aTile

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,769
function, or maybe someone on our team who
is responsible for this simply forgets to

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,359
add a new case here.

00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,710
What would happen?

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,399
The compiler wouldn't warn us about this.

00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:41,109
We like to be warned by the compiler
about possible errors in our code.

00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:47,840
But if I produce 5 here, but also forget to
adapt the 'aTile' function, then the compiler

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,690
has no chance of warning me.

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,690
Why not?

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,409
Because the 5 will run into this last case.

00:23:55,409 --> 00:24:00,799
So, actually, even though I add my 5 in my
'level' function, the drawing code will simply

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,419
draw nothing for these positions because
we run into this 'blank' case here.

00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,820
This blank case made sense before, right?

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,030
Because in our examples in the exercise, the
only number codes we had were 0 up to 4, and

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,659
0 was intended to stand for “nothing”, so
of course, 0 would run into this last case,

00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,070
then 'blank' would be taken.

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,330
But now when we extend the 'level' function
and forget about this change in the 'aTile'

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,759
function, then suddenly we also have 'blank'
for our new place where we actually want to

00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,759
have spikes.

00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:38,639
Now, you could say: that is the error in our
original design for the 'aTile' function.

00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:42,809
We shouldn't have written the '_' (underscore),
we should have written 0 here, then the compiler

00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:44,090
would certainly realize that…

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:50,549
At least at runtime, it wouldn't draw blank
because 5 wouldn't match any of these cases.

00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,879
So, at least at runtime, you would get an
error instead of this strange blank Picture.

00:24:54,879 --> 00:25:01,169
This is something you could achieve by simply
writing a '0' here in the original version.

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:04,269
But that of course also has its disadvantages
because then the compiler would complain about

00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,929
this not being an exhaustive function.

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:11,080
And the compiler would be correct because if
you only say: the 'aTile' function goes from

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,789
Integer to Picture, and then you only provide
cases for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, then we haven't written

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,880
a function in the mathematical sense.

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,090
And why is that?

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,929
Because the Integer size is much too big.

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,950
The 'level' doesn't give an
Integer; it gives a tile.

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,529
So, we should use a more descriptive,
a more meaningful type here.

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,529
And what could that be?

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,879
It can't be a number type.

00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:41,409
It should be an enumeration
or an algebraic datatype.

130 # slide
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:48,450
So, that is how it could look like if you
introduce a new type called Tile, and we introduce

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:55,279
some constants of that type, and we introduce
exactly one constant for each kind of tile

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,980
we want to have: Blank (nothing),
Pearl, Water, Air.

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,649
This has clear documentation value.

00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:09,019
Also, there cannot, from now on, be any confusion
related to number codes, so which is which?

00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,019
Is it 2 the pearl?

00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,019
Or 3 is the pearl?

00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:14,119
So, there are no number codes anymore;
we have these descriptive names.

00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,419
And they will be used in all of our functions.

00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,009
It also means that the order is not relevant.

00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:26,000
Neither is the order relevant when we list
these things here because there are no numbers

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,009
involved, and nor is the order relevant when
we write cases for these constants in our

00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,309
function definitions.

00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,769
So, let's say we use this type; then now, of
course, our 'level' function would have this

00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:39,769
type.

00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,210
It doesn't go from (Integer, Integer) to
Integer, but rather from (Integer, Integer)

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,210
to Tile.

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,470
This also makes the roles much clearer.

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,720
So, these remain Integers because they are
coordinates, but what comes out is not just

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
a number.

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,330
It is a Tile because that is what the level
is: for positions, it gives us a description

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,190
of what is at that position.

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:06,659
So, it is now the type of our 'level' function,
and then 'aTile' function looks like this.

00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,309
It doesn't go from Integer to
Picture, but from Tile to Picture.

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:11,870
And of course, the mapping
here is very straightforward.

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:18,369
Also, we don't need a catch-all case because
we have exactly five values of the Tile type.

00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:25,129
So, if you give a definition, a line, for each
of these constants, then this is a complete

00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:29,890
definition, and the compiler will
find out that this is a non-redundant

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,450
and complete definition of
a function of that type.

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,159
So, there is no need for a catch-all case
as in the previous case, where this actually

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:47,460
led to problems when we wanted to extend our
support/range of things that can be tiles.

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,690
Now, what would happen if we wanted to
introduce a new tile, like the Spike thing?

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,850
We would have to add it to this type.

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,809
Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible
to return it in the level.

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,950
So, we cannot return anything from the
'level' function which isn't in this type.

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,769
So, if we want to have spikes, then we introduce
a new case of spikes here; then we can use

00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:14,879
it in the 'level' function, and it cannot happen
to us that we forget to declare or describe

00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,240
how to handle this in the 'aTile' function.

00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Why?

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,309
Because if I add Spike to this type, but I
forget to add also a case for it in the aTile

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:25,450
function, then the compiler will complain.

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,450
The compiler will help me.

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,309
It will warn if we forget a new value.

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,341
So, everything has to fit: If I want to use
a new thing here, I have to add it to the

00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,019
type; then I can use it here.

00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:40,190
But then also, I can't forget to handle it
here because the compiler would complain

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,190
about this.

00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:48,299
That is the value of this
kind of checking.

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,639
And these checks that are possible now: both
for completeness and for redundancy might

00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:57,049
seem trivial in a simple function like this,
but at scale, in larger programs, in larger

00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:02,480
libraries with many functions with complicated
invariants maybe, this can be very important.

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,999
So, everything that we can do to make the
compiler help us in detecting inconsistencies

00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,140
is valuable.

00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,869
And defining our own types and using them
in a reasonable way in our functions, both

00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:20,799
for outputs and for inputs,
is a way to achieve this.

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,059
Now, on this very simple example, you
might also wonder: why even have this?

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:31,090
It looks very trivial, to match
'Blank' to 'blank', 'Block' to 'block',

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,090
etc…

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,580
Why don't we simply let our 'level'
function return Pictures instead?

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,071
Then we can scrap this whole thing, and the
'level' function would simply say: given two

00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:45,059
Integers, I give you a Picture, and then,
instead of returning the constant uppercase

00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,779
Block, it would simply return
the Picture block here.

00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:53,529
That would be a reasonable design, you might
think, but it would lose a lot of potential

00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,960
for manipulations because you also want
to use this 'level' function as data.

00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
You have seen this.

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,269
We had this exercise task where you are given
two level functions and you should decide

00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:08,859
which one of them is smaller
or more densely populated.

00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:10,109
And what did you do there?

00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:15,779
You applied these level functions to some
coordinates and compared their outcomes.

00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:21,039
Now, that is possible with numbers, but numbers
have a disadvantage, as explained in the previous

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,549
slide, and discussed here again.

00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,620
If you use Pictures here,
then you can't compare them.

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,960
So, given some arbitrary two Pictures, there
is no way to really, reasonably compare them.

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,999
So, you need data here…
something which can be inspected.

00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,710
And well… constants like this have this
property.

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:45,979
So, going from numbers to this new type allows
us, both, to have a meaningful drawing function,

00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:51,100
but also still treat this level as data, where
we actually can look at the outcome for a

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,539
certain position and compute with this,
like comparing a block vs a pearl, etc…

00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,440
comparing in the sense of: is one
a block and the other a pearl?

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,980
Or one is water and the other is a pearl,
etc., not comparison in the sense of numbers.

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,960
That's why we want to have something that
is not a Picture here, something that we can

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,570
work with, like these constants that we can
look at, and then we need something like this

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,200
function.

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,190
But thanks to this enumeration type, such
a function can be safely implemented in a

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:29,159
non-redundant, but also an exhaustive
way, which is checked by the compiler.

131 # slide
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,019
These were simple enumeration types.

00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:35,479
Now, let's go beyond that.

00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:43,190
We move into an area where it is not just
named constants that we could easily simulate

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,799
with numbers like in C or something like that.

00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,229
Let's do more general algebraic datatypes.

00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:54,210
In what sense will they be more general?

00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,749
Now, they can encapsulate additional
values in these alternatives.

00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:05,320
So far, we had, for example: a Day can be Monday,
Tuesday, etc., or a Tile can be Water, Pearl,

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,470
Block, and Blank or whatever.

00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:13,710
These are the alternatives that we write with this
logical bar '|' (pipe). Now, each of these alternatives

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:23,669
may take additional values in the sense of
a record, so, keeping some additional data.

00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:24,669
What does this mean?

00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,499
The data constructors now can take arguments.

00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:31,049
They are not just constants, they are
now functions that take arguments.

00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:37,559
Syntactically, this means to enrich what
we can write in these data definitions.

00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:44,059
So, actually, let me show three data definitions
that are related to each other / depend on

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:46,340
each other, namely, what we see here.

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,899
I defined a new type Date and
it has only one alternative.

00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,039
So, there is no vertical bar here
for other enumeration options.

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,499
There is only one option, which is: Day is
a data constructor, and then there are three

00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:05,730
arguments, and the types are written
here, because this is a type definition.

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:13,370
Some things to note: first, here I use Day
as a data constructor, whereas a few slides

00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,960
back I used it as a type constructor.

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,330
I said that I wouldn't usually do this.

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,799
So, imagine that this is an example
that is separate from the previous one.

00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:26,879
So, I wouldn't use this and the other definition
of data Day (as Monday, Tuesday, etc.) in

00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,879
the same program.

00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:33,269
So, let's say it is a separate program,
so that I can avoid this confusion.

00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:40,809
I define a new type: Date, which has only one
alternative, namely: Day (as a data constructor),

00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:45,519
but Day is not constant, it has three arguments
of type Integer, the idea, of course, being

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,049
that I will store the day of the
month, the number of the month…

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:58,480
You could say: I should actually use January,
February, etc. here, instead of numbers, but

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,340
usually, dates are stored
as number number number.

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,889
So, let me do this here as well.

00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:09,320
Then I have another type, which is Time.

00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:15,210
I have decided that, for my time,
I only want to store the hours.

00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:21,070
So, Time is simply constructed by
saying: the hours are so-and-so.

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,929
We can store 11 AM or something like that.

00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,460
What I am actually interested in, is the new
type Connection which is based on these custom

00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
types.

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
So, what is a connection?

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,110
I want to be able to talk about
both train and flight connections.

00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,600
So, these would be my alternatives: Train or
Flight, like Monday and Tuesday, but actually

00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,060
Train and Flight are not simply constants
as Monday and Tuesday are, but rather they

00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,150
carry some data.

00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,260
And they carry different data.

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,690
So, each of them has its own
set of constructor arguments.

00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:01,420
So, for example, for a train, I want to store
the date and two Times, namely the departure

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,260
time and the arrival time.

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,850
That is something I can say here.

00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:12,480
And of course, the Day and Time and Time values
here will be constructed in the way that these

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,090
two definitions here declare.

00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,901
Also, there are flight connections.

00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:18,970
And for flights, I store something else.

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,270
I store the airline, and let's
say this is stored as a String.

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:30,080
And then I also store the date on which this
flight connection takes place, and two Times

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,260
for departure and arrival.

00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,800
What you see is that these definitions can depend
on each other, like I can use an own-defined

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,480
type in another own-defined type.

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,470
Also, the order is not relevant here.

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,630
So, it is just that for function definitions,
I don't have to define these types before

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,350
I define these types or something like that.

00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,100
So, this can be mutually dependent.

00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,220
It doesn't happen in this case,
but it could be, in general.

00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,270
So, now let's look at an example.

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,160
What would it be like to know a value
of, for example, the Connection type?

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,701
Of course, it becomes a bit more complicated
to construct these values now because they

00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:11,660
are just constants like Monday, Tuesday, etc.

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,540
A value of this type would be
either a Train or a Flight.

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,270
So, let's say we want to store a value for
Train.

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:26,010
Then, Train would be the name that appears…
the constructor's name (just Monday, Tuesday)

00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,130
what we used as a constant.

00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,230
And now, of course, this is a function.

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,960
So, it takes three arguments.

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,890
The first argument would be a Date
which will be constructed like this.

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:40,050
So, it will be something with the constructor
Day and then three numbers, then two Times,

00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,700
namely, of the form Hour and a number (Integer).

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,540
A possible value of this Connection
type could look like this.

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,550
This follows this scheme.

00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:57,120
It is Train… and that I used Train tells
me that I need three arguments here.

00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,280
And what would the types be if I
had written Flight here instead?

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,670
Then we would need three arguments and
there should be a String here in addition.

00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,250
But for Train, I have three arguments.

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,990
The first one is a Date.

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,540
And a Date is a Day with
three numbers, as we see here.

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,960
And the two Times are things of the
form Hour and a number (Integer).

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,880
And now, of course, this can be nested.

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,560
And this corresponds to trees.

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,890
And I will draw this on the whiteboard
in the whiteboard app to illustrate this.

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:31,480
But written as a value in the interpreter,
for example, or in code, would be simply like

00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:40,000
this, seeing these as functions
that are applied to arguments.

132 # slide
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,480
Then how do we compute on such values…
values of this type that we have just seen?

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,490
Via something called pattern-matching.

00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,420
That is the underlying concept here.

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,860
And it is something that we have seen many
times already, but we have just applied it

00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,310
to values … like this aTile of
Block is equal to something.

00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,700
It was already pattern-matching.

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:09,630
It matched against a constant pattern: Block
or Pearl, etc. same as for weekdays, and also

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,000
for numbers before.

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,950
Now, this pattern-matching concept
becomes a possibly deeply nested concept.

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:22,261
So, if you want to define what the travel
time for a Connection is, we could say: What

00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,261
is a Connection?

00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:25,080
A Connection is either a Train or a Flight.

00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,100
That is what the previous definition
from the previous slide says.

00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:34,300
And you also know that if it is a Train, then
it has three arguments: a Date which we maybe

00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,280
want to ignore if we want to
compute how long the travel takes.

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,830
It doesn't really depend on the date on which
the travel happens, but it depends rather

00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,450
on the departure and arrival times.

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,250
So, we could say something like: travelTime
of a Train connection, no matter what the

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,460
date is on which it takes place, if we have
the departure as 'd' and the arrival as

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,410
'a', then the travelTime is the arrival hour
minus the departure hour plus one because

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,020
you need some time to get to the
railway station or something like that.

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,670
So, this is one alternative because Connection
has an alternative: it could be a Train, and

00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,770
it could also be a Flight.

00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,850
So, we should also write another case.

00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,850
So, a case for 'travelTime'
function for Flight connections.

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:19,080
And the description/the definition of this
data constructor tells us how many arguments

00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
it has.

00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,530
It has a String argument for the airline,
but we assume that the travel time doesn't

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,530
depend on this.

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,380
Also, the date shouldn't be relevant.

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,550
We have departure and arrival hours, but for a
Flight, we have to add two hours for getting

00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,310
to the airport and checking in, etc.

00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:44,390
So, this could be a descriptive way of explaining
how travelTime comes into play / is defined

00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,370
for Trains and Flights.

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,480
Is this a complete case distinction?

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,030
Yes, it is, because the Connection type
has exactly these two alternatives.

00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,880
And the compiler will make sure
that we don't forget anything here.

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,430
So, if you had only written the first line,
then the compiler could warn and ask: you

00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:07,320
say you have defined a function travelTime
from Connection to Integer, but you have only

00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,650
defined it for some patterns,
namely for Train, not for Flight.

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,230
That is where the
descriptiveness comes into play.

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,640
Also, overlapping patterns.

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,650
So, if we have two ways of defining / saying
something about Train, which is for some reason

00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:27,060
could be relevant because maybe if the Hour
is 12, so, if you start at noon, for some

00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,630
reason, then this summand must
be different, or whatever.

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,550
So, you could think of further cases here.

00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:38,000
And then the compiler could check that we
don't have redundancy, we don't have some

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,380
case that would be covered by two different
lines, and it doesn't make sense to have

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,080
a definition like that, thanks to this precise
definition of what a Connection is on the

00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
previous slide.

00:40:52,080 --> 00:41:01,700
I will also show this on the whiteboard app to
illustrate more clearly how this deep nesting

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,770
works, how we get the values for 'd' and
'a', for example on some example like

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,010
on the previous slide.

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,340
I will show this, how this translates basically
to selecting parts of the tree when we match

00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,840
against a value.

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:26,050
And then at the same time, apart from the
role of data constructors to serve as names

00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,460
in this pattern-matching, they are also
still functions, just as I said before.

00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,950
These data constructors have this double role:
they are things that we can match against

00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,140
in a definition like this, but
they are also constructors of data.

00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,010
They are normal functions.

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,520
Here are their types.

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:50,440
So, as I said before, a Date is always constructed
by Day with three arguments, namely three

00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Integers.

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,480
That means that Day is a function which
takes three Integers and returns a Date.

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,700
Something like Day 4 4 2012 is a Date because
it is the result of this function applied

00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,170
to these three arguments.

00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,590
And likewise, Train and Flight are functions.

00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,990
So, for example, there are two
different ways to construct Connections.

00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,260
One of them is with the Train constructor.

00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,750
And the type definition for Connection tells
us that Train has three arguments: Date Time

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,900
Time.

00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,170
So, actually, Train is a function of this
type.

00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:31,040
It can be used to construct values of type
Connection, but it can also be used in any

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,890
other way that functions can be used.

00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:38,480
So, thinking back to higher-order functions
from last week, these constructors Day and

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,860
Train, they could also be arguments to higher-order
functions, if we have something which takes

00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:50,130
either polymorphically or with concrete types
something of this form with three arguments

00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,130
and a result.

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:56,350
So, they have all the rights that normal functions
have, even though we don't define them with

00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,350
function definitions.

00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:02,100
So, these functions Day and Train, they are
introduced when the type Connection or the

00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,280
type Date is defined.

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,950
They are not user-defined functions,
per se, as functions like this are.

00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,940
But they are just functions that can be used
in any way that Haskell allows a function

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,230
to be used.

00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:21,070
And that is important for structuring programs
and making good use of all the facilities

00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,670
that we have.
