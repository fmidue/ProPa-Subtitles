104 # slide
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:09,320
This week, we get to talk about what
is called higher-order functions.

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,370
And when we say higher-order functions, then
probably there is also something else like

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,070
a lower-order function; but actually, they
are not called lower-order functions, but

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,070
rather first-order functions.

00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,960
And almost everything you have seen so far
of Haskell, and certainly everything you have

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,610
written yourself in Haskell (unless you have
somehow done something in addition to this

00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,960
lecture), have been first-order functions.

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,240
Now, higher-order functions are a very essential
ingredient of the functional programming paradigm.

00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:45,890
Actually, if we had only first-order functions,
then the paradigm wouldn't be so interesting.

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:54,590
Higher-order functions are what basically
gets us from programming *of* functions to

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,320
actually programming *with* functions and
programming *on* functions, so dealing with

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,509
functions themselves as ingredients, in a
sense, as data on which we can program further

00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:07,509
functions.

00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,530
So, that is what higher-order is about.

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,939
And you have already seen a few higher-order
functions, maybe without explicitly noticing

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:15,939
it.

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:19,999
Because you didn't have to do anything with
them other than simply leave them as they

00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,530
were given in the task templates.

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,020
Here I will briefly remind
you of these instances.

00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,859
And then we will look at a few, probably,
somewhat bizarre looking examples first.

00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:36,591
Also, there is certain new syntax that becomes
important when we want to program with higher-order

00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,591
functions.

00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,591
So, I have to introduce *this*.

00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:42,130
And some of this will maybe look
very strange at the beginning.

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:48,759
And then we will come back again to more useful
cases, so some things that you will actually

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,439
use in the exercises, or that are generally
important for programming in Haskell.

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:04,520
As I have just said, so far, we have
mainly dealt with first-order functions.

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,890
So, functions that take normal data as input
arguments and ultimately return something

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,580
which is also normal data.

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,280
By "normal data" we mean things like lists,
numbers, pairs, pairs of numbers, lists of

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,840
numbers, lists of pairs, etc.

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,660
It is concrete data that you can print and
pass to another function, and the output may

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,020
be also printed.

00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,440
So, if you think of functions that you
have seen, actually the 'reverse' function:

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,020
You give it a list, it gives back a list.

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,630
That is a typical first-order function.

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,800
Or, the addition of numbers
is a first-order function:

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,280
You give it two numbers,
it gives you back a number.

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,490
That's first-order, normal data.

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,400
In a few occasions, we have actually at
least got in touch already with higher-order

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,320
functions, namely 'quickCheck' and 'animationOf'.

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,670
So, if you think about 'quickCheck' as the driver
of this testing approach, and 'animationOf'

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,630
as one of the main drivers of the CodeWorld
approach (of this small language for describing

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,630
animations), these two are
higher-order functions.

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,390
Because we passed other functions to them.

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,800
In the case of quickCheck, we didn't
call this out very explicitly.

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,460
But actually, what we gave to
'quickCheck' were functions.

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,230
So, I mentioned that I give a property to
quickCheck: something like expressing that

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,470
whenever we have two lists, then the length
of their concatenation is the same as the

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,140
sum of the lengths.

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,150
That is something like "for all xs, for
all ys, the following condition holds".

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,840
Well, this is really a predicate.

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,000
It is a function.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,280
You give it normal data values like lists,
and it gives you a Boolean value (True or

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
False).

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
So, it's a predicate.

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,160
And a predicate is a function from some
domain to True and False (the Bool type).

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,310
And 'quickCheck' took such
a predicate as an argument.

00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:02,120
So, if 'quickCheck' is seen as a function, which
it should be because what we are using here

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,600
from the QuickCheck library is a function; you
give it a predicate, and it does something

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
with it.

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,820
It is a function to which you give another
function (a predicate) as an argument.

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,600
And similarly for 'animationOf'.

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,060
If you remember: First, in
CodeWorld, we programmed Pictures.

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,900
So, then we had something like simply
a Picture, that is first-order data.

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,979
The first scene calls were using 'drawingOf'.

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,729
And to 'drawingOf' you gave a Picture and
then it did something with it, namely, put

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,770
it on the screen.

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,610
For 'animationOf' we did something else.

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,300
We had to program a function.

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,759
And what did we do with this function?

00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,939
We gave it to 'animationOf'.

00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:44,800
So, we had something like "main = animationOf
scene" (as an argument, the 'scene' function).

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,389
So, we had animations, functions
from "time" to Picture.

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,469
And then we gave such a
function to 'animationOf'.

00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:54,979
So, 'animationOf' again was a function.

00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,729
It took an argument which itself was a function.

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:04,229
This is the contrast here between 'animationOf'
and 'drawingOf', for example, or 'quickCheck'

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,819
and other functions that we have seen.

00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,129
So, let's indeed look at
the type of 'animationOf'.

00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:17,650
We could make a similar observation for
'quickCheck', but let's do it on 'animationOf'.

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,650
What do we have here?

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,650
So, this is the type.

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,289
I have never really shown that type in the
lecture, and partly because you might have

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,490
been surprised at that point because we didn't
have the concepts for talking about this.

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,129
But actually, if we do give the type, then
unlike 'drawingOf', where we would simply

00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:41,099
have "the argument as a Picture, and the outcome
is: do something interactive, in this case,

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,849
drawing it to the browser window", now
"animationOf" gets a function as an argument.

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,699
So, what we are saying here is: the first
argument of 'animationOf' is itself a function

00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,310
from Double to Picture, and
then there is some output.

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,310
The latter is the interactive aspect.

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,150
But the interesting bit is this part here, and
in particular, that there are these brackets.

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:11,550
This is important here, to indicate that this
whole part here constitutes the input, namely

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,439
the *input* is a function from Double to Picture;
and not that 'animationOf' is a function somehow

00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,590
of two arguments: Double and Picture,
and then something comes out.

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,319
That would be a wrong way of reading it.

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,589
So, these brackets here are really important.

00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:29,340
And we will come back to this syntax
difference and its importance.

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,970
An important note here: Every
function is a value, of course.

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,779
So, usually, you think about functions
as taking values as arguments.

00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:42,620
And once you realize that a function is itself
also a value (mathematically), there is no

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,020
real surprise, maybe, that a function
can take another function as an argument.

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,479
That may be a surprise only because in
programming, we often cannot do this so simply.

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,669
But mathematically, if we accept (and we should)
that every function is also a value, then

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,809
clearly, functions that can take values as
arguments should also be allowed to take functions

00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:05,979
as arguments (if the type
allows this, like in this case).

00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:09,729
Conversely, not every value is a function.

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:16,830
We have values in Haskell, like values of type
Double, to which you cannot pass an argument.

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,360
So, Double itself is not a function.

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,990
"Double → Picture" is a function.

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:26,460
And to this function you can give an
argument, like the time Double value 3.5.

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,069
But a value of type Double is of course not
a function, so you cannot give an argument

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,979
to it.

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,349
That is a really important observation
and thing to keep in mind:

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:42,009
Every function is a value, of course, mathematically
speaking, and that's then embodied here in

00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,410
how we can program with these entities.
But not every value is a function.

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,599
So, saying something like: "Haskell is a functional
language. So, everything in Haskell is a function."

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,699
... that wouldn't be true.

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,270
So, we have to be careful of this.

00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,159
Also, maybe when I talked about 'quickCheck'
here, I almost stumbled about this.

00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,369
Of course, we also have
things that are not functions.

00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:11,689
So, here is the type, again, of 'animationOf'.

00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,580
And here more explicitly what I
already said on the previous slide.

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,849
These brackets here are very important because
without them, the type would mean something

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,379
completely different.

00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:32,130
Remember that on the expression level, basically
for data, for expressions, for values, we

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,710
(and also Autotool) somehow pushed you
into the direction of using fewer brackets.

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,930
There were all of these
warnings/suggestions like:

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,960
"You don't need brackets here, write
it more simply with fewer brackets."

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,200
On the type level, for example, between this
type and this type, you will not get these

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,480
kinds of warnings because it
would be completely wrong.

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,870
These mean completely different things.

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,100
This is a thing that takes a function as
an argument and then something happens.

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,190
And this type here says: We have a function to
which we give two normal values (two non-function

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,200
values), namely a Double (a number) and a
Picture, and then something is drawn, for

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
example.

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,390
So, with this 'animationOf' version in the
second line here, you could only provide a

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,010
number and a fixed Picture.

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,710
That wouldn't be the basis
for an actual animation.

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,700
For that, we need a function.

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,220
And the brackets here explain/indicate this.

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,430
So, these brackets here are very
significant and can't be omitted.

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:38,830
And to drive home this point, I will discuss
this on a simpler example where we don't have

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,560
this strange 'IO' here, which
maybe also confuses you.

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,400
So, I will make an example where we have just
numbers, but the same kind of difference between

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,080
something like this and
something like this will appear.

00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:02,500
So, this is the example that I want to use
for this discussion: a simple function you

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,870
have seen many times before.

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,690
So, from the syntax perspective, a
function that takes two arguments.

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,230
And we know that that's how this
is written: Int to Int to Int.

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,900
Two inputs that are integers and
an output that is also an integer.

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,570
Now you can ask yourself: What
are some functions of that type?

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,390
And I'm sure you can immediately have some
ideas of functions that you could, right now,

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,870
program in Haskell and they have this type.

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,570
Something like adding two numbers or any kind
of other arithmetic combination of two inputs,

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,310
x and y, for example.

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,700
In contrast, we have this type where we added
these brackets, which, we now know, mean that

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,270
this part here means we have a function as an
argument instead of two numbers as arguments.

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:57,690
And then, to think about what kind of things
"live" in this type, so what kind of things

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:04,310
that you can write in Haskell would have this
type, as a whole (not only the input type,

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,310
but the type of this 'f' as a whole).

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,860
What could 'f' actually be?

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,290
There are two things we have to wonder about:

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,630
What kind of inputs?

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,430
What can we give to this 'f'?
And we know this: two numbers.

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,670
And what kind of inputs can we give to this
'f'?

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,170
And intuitively, we know: well,
functions from integers to integers.

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,770
Not two arguments, but instead here
one is input and one is output.

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,320
And then, what can these
functions do with their inputs?

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,460
For this type, we know what this
function can do with its numbers.

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,850
It can look at them, add them, subtract them,
multiply them, do more complicated computations,

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,560
for example.

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
What about this function?

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Knowing that it takes a
function as an argument is nice.

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,670
But now, what does it do with that argument?

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,670
That's the question here.

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:59,120
And we have to decide, or actually the language
design decides what 'f' can do with the argument.

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
There are different choices.

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,000
For example, we could imagine:

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,970
Maybe if we give to this 'f' a function, then
maybe 'f' can take this function, look at its

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:13,000
function definition, and work with the syntax,
with the body of that function definition,

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
for example.

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,020
Should this be allowed or not?

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,660
So, what can 'f' do?

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:24,000
That's something we need to discuss in order
to get a good grasp of what really happens in

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,630
such a higher-order function, or
what makes a higher-order function.

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,860
So, let's do this with
these two simple functions.

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,840
And the main point is about
the second one, of course.

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:44,190
The first one is just a standard function
kind, of which you have already seen examples.

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:56,600
So, let's consider this first example:
functions of this simple first-order type.

00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,850
What could be such functions?

00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,110
And I have already mentioned some.

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,690
So, for example, the function that takes two
arguments x and y (and we know the syntax

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:15,021
for a two-argument function) and then the
output could be x + y, or of course, f x y

00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,021
= x – y.

00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:22,530
Or maybe 'f' ignores the first argument
and simply returns the second one.

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:30,840
Or maybe 'f' will even ignore both
arguments and return 12 or some other thing.

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,510
We could write more complex
expressions on the right-hand side.

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,700
So, these are functions of this type.

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:43,000
And I don't mean one function with these
four definitions, but basically one of them.

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,810
So, 'f :: ...' and the first one or second one
or the third one or the fourth one, each of

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,150
these lines, together with the signature above,
would give a reasonable function of that type

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,460
we see here.

00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:04,450
Let's look in contrast at functions of the
other type, which was written like this, with

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,040
these extra brackets.

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,930
And I have already indicated or tried
to explain why they are important.

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:16,010
And now we see this in more detail.

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,170
So, what would this be?

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,230
So, it's a function.

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,470
It has to take an argument.

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,750
What would be its argument?

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,430
The argument is only one, namely the
thing that is written in brackets above.

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,640
It takes as argument a function.

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,440
So, let's maybe not call this x.

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,380
Let's call this g or h, which
sounds more like a function.

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,360
So, this takes only one
argument, which is a function.

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,750
Let's call it h.

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,840
And then it has to return something.

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,870
What does it have to return?

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,870
An integer.

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,640
Because that is what appears on the right-hand
side of the outer function arrow above.

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,730
So, what could it return?

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,630
Well, maybe let's use the 'h' somehow.

00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,160
We have a function from Int to Int,
and we should give back an Int.

00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
What could we do?

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Well, we could take this 'h' and apply it
to 7.

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,210
Yes, 'h' is a function from Int to Int.

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,020
We give it an Int, it returns
an Int, whatever h of 7 is.

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,580
And that's the outcome of our f-function,
given the h-function as an input.

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,470
That would be *a* reasonable definition.

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,470
Or something else.

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,750
Again, I will write down several lines, and
each of them itself is a reasonable definition

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,680
of 'f' with the type above.

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,280
So, for example, we could also decide to
ignore the function argument (the argument that

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,150
is a function) here, and just like on the
left-hand side, return 12 or 17, or whatever.

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,420
That would be a reasonable function f.

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,410
What else could 'f' do with its input?

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,360
The input is a function h.

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,580
What could 'f' do with a
function 'h' (from Int to Int)?

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,930
Of course, it could apply it
to other things than 7 above.

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,380
But there are more things that it could do.

00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:01,930
For example, it could apply this h-function to
the result of 'h' applied to 13, so 'h (h 13)',

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,680
or other combinations.

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:14,191
Or it could decide to call 'h' once on 4, so
'h 4', and add this together with the result of

00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:16,820
'h' on 7, 'h 7'.

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,350
Or, again, very many further possibilities.

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,100
So, again, this is meant as an "or",
many lines that would be possible.

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,620
And completely different lines on the
left and on the right, of course.

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
That's the important point.

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,200
So, on the left we have a function that takes
two numbers as arguments and then does something

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,410
with these numbers (and you know many things
that you could do with numbers), while on

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,440
the right we have a function that
takes a function as an argument.

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,420
And then there are fewer things that you
can do with this, but still quite a few.

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,560
So, you cannot add 'h' to 'h', for example.

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,590
Since 'h' is a function.

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,630
You cannot add two functions.

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,500
But you can apply 'h' to
something, then you get a number.

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,020
And with this number, you can continue computing,
like outputting it directly, passing it again

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:06,500
to h, combining it with other values that
come out of h, for other inputs, etc.

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:16,380
What we see on the right here, we call
this extensional uses of this function.

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,350
That is a notion from mathematics:
function extensionality.

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:32,230
What this means is that we are
not looking at the syntax of h.

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:41,460
(I don't know why this above
was somehow struck through.)

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,920
So, what I mean here: pure extensional uses.

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,030
We are not looking at the syntax of h.

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,420
So, 'f' gets 'h' as an argument.

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
It can work with it.

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,860
It can apply it to numbers,
work with the results, etc.

00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,790
But 'f' cannot, for example, look
into the syntax of 'h' and say:

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,180
"Oh, you are a function from Int to Int. Let me
look whether you do this by case distinction,

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,530
or whether you are a constant function."

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,800
Or something like that.

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,710
That's not what a function can do
with an argument which is a function.

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,920
We have pure extensional uses.

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,570
And that means using the argument, in this
case h, as a mathematical function: applying

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:26,660
it to values and getting other values out.

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,440
Then, a reasonable question at this point
is:

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,720
Where do we get those functions from, that we
can pass as arguments to higher-order functions?

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,410
In the previous slide, where do we
get the h from that we pass to f?

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,840
I showed you 'f' of 'h' is
something, some definitions.

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,950
But if I want to call the function f, I must give
it some argument, which should be a function.

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,170
Where do I get those functions from?

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,190
That shouldn't be a problem, right?

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,800
Functions are almost everywhere in Haskell.

00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,430
There shouldn't be any shortage of supply.

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,180
We have plenty of functions around.

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,970
We simply have to choose some that we consider
useful to be passed as arguments to f.

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,830
So, of course, we could take
any predefined function.

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,380
They have names, so they
can be used as arguments.

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,150
We can refer to them by their name
and then pass them as arguments to f.

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,360
In the previous example, if we take some
predefined functions from Int to Int.

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,809
We could use functions that we have
explicitly defined in our own program.

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:33,200
That is exactly what you did when you passed
your own 'scene' function, that you programmed,

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,380
as an argument to 'animationOf'.

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,380
The 'animationOf' expects a function.

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,060
You have written a function 'scene'.

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,840
So, you pass one to the other.

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:49,280
And, an important example way of producing,
or having, functions are partial applications

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,790
of any of the above kinds of functions
(predefined functions, own functions).

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,590
Once we have a function with two arguments,
we can also make a function with one argument.

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:04,150
There is a simple example here, and I will
briefly discuss this on the next slide.

00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:12,960
But, for example, plus (+) in Haskell is a
function from two integers (Int) to one Int.

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,390
And if you pass one Int to the 'plus' function,
then what you get is a function from one Int

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,390
to one Int.

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:25,970
We have already discussed this bit when I talked
about eta-reduction in one of the previous

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,270
videos, where I talked also about why the
Haskell function syntax is like it is.

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,540
In particular, it is like this
to allow partial application.

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,410
That is: If I have a two-argument function,
I can make a one-argument function from it

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,429
by providing the first argument.

00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,640
On the previous slide, we had this f, and
it took an "Int to Int" as an argument.

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,860
It could, for example, take
the "(+) 5" as an argument.

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,360
That is useful.

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Of course, it depends on what we want to do,
but the point is we have the possibility to

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,970
make a function from Int to Int by taking a
function which takes two integer arguments

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,010
and providing one of them.

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,870
And these partial applications we see here,
they have all the rights of any other function

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,270
or value in Haskell.

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,240
So, they can be passed as an
argument to some other function.

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,200
They can be stored in a
data structure, for example.

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:30,240
So, let us see and let's use, from the slide
before, the function "f h" is "h is applied to

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
7", I think.

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,160
So, that was one of these functions "from
Int to Int, as a function, goes to Int".

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,610
And let's call this 'f' on one
of these partial applications.

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,910
It was written like this: plus is a binary
operation (+) which takes two numbers, we

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,690
give it one number, then we
have a function from Int to Int.

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,660
And this function, we give to f.

00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,280
So, what does this mean?

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:04,201
Well, then this is h, and the right-hand side
of 'f h = h 7' means, so this above says, that

00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:10,350
we will have 'h' applied to 7.

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:20,470
Which means: the plus function (+) applied
to 5, because this is h, and then applied

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,660
to 7, which is simply 12.

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:30,910
Right, the plus function (+)
applied to 5 and 7, which is 12.

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,480
So, we simply use 'h' as an argument,
and place it wherever it needs to be.

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,130
It needs to be the function to
which we pass 7 as an argument.

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,179
So, then we have "h 7" is
"(+) 5 of 7", (+) 5 7, which is 12.

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:50,220
And on the next slide, I think, we
will also see another syntax quirk.

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,750
So, actually, this "(+) applied to 5"
can also be written in a different way.

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,081
Equivalently, we can write something like
this.

00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,630
This is called a section.

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:10,570
So, this strange incomplete-looking
addition here, this also could be 'h'.

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,740
It is the same as above, just a different
syntax.

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,820
Then it becomes even more obvious
what is happening here, in some sense.

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,360
So, then what we have, again, f h is something.

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
What is 'f' of 'h'?

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
It is 'h' of 7.

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,800
So, it is this 'h' here applied to 7.

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:31,770
So, it is this incomplete-looking
(5 +), which is 'h', applied to 7.

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,230
And then we, even more directly,
see 5 + 7, which is 12.

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,090
And again, this 'h' is used extensionally, here.

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:46,549
So, it is not like that the f function looks
at its argument and sees how it is written,

00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,549
what it is doing.

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:49,520
No, it is simply saying: f h is h 7.

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,060
So, it uses the 'h' extensionally as a function.

00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:00,940
And all we can really do is pass
some argument to it; in this case, 7.

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:17,640
(I keep getting these strange changes to what I
have written. I don't know why this is happening,

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:28,590
actually. Apparently, I am not yet very
firm in this new note-taking thing here.)

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:42,640
So, 'h' is used purely extensionally.

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,730
Which means all you can do with the function,
really, apart from storing it in data structures,

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,880
passing it around, is to
apply it to some argument.

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,210
Which happens here with the
h, when it is applied to 7.

00:24:52,210 --> 00:25:04,500
One way to get a better grasp
of this partial application

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,840
business is probably to realize that, actually,
the type "Int to Int to Int" ('Int → Int → Int'),

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,200
that would also be the type of the plus operator
(+), can also be read as: 'Int → (Int → Int)',

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,840
that is: Int to a bracket
that contains "Int to Int".

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,660
We just discussed this difference for the
f function between having brackets around

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,190
this part or not.

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,390
Now I am saying, the case where we don't have
brackets around this first arrow here is equivalent

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,990
or could be read as this one
where we add brackets around here.

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,940
And indeed, these brackets can be omitted.

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,160
So, this is, again, where we would say: don't
write these brackets because it is clear

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,570
enough that this is a function of two
arguments which returns an integer.

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,440
We could also see it as this.

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,679
And then what we are actually seeing it as,
is that this is a function which takes one

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,450
number and gives back a function from Int
to Int.

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,170
So, this is the viewpoint of partial application.

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:10,820
On one hand, a function (in this viewpoint)
which takes two integers and returns one integer.

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:19,490
Or, from the second perspective: a function
that takes one integer and returns a function,

00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,330
which is a function (in this case) that takes
one integer, namely this one, and returns

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,559
one integer.

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,940
That is just a viewpoint question
between this and this syntax.

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,070
But they are the same, mathematically.

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,720
Having a function which takes two numbers
and gives a number is the same as having a

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,100
function which takes a number and returns
a function which waits for another number

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,570
and then gives back the result.

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,140
This is, again, something that I discussed
when I discussed the eta-reduction on the

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,400
example of the opening rectangle before.

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,080
So, both of these viewpoints are valid.

00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,670
There is no difference in usage, whether
we consider one or the other perspective.

00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,630
And this is thanks to Haskell's function application
syntax, and also the reason why Haskell function

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:12,140
definitions are with this syntax, without
commas and brackets (but rather with basically

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,370
just space as function application).

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,360
So, to make these two viewpoints equivalent.

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,860
Because mathematically, they are equivalent.

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:26,059
This also means that, in some sense, many
first-order functions can also be seen as

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:27,059
higher-order functions.

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,669
We could even say: this first-order function,
the addition, is in some sense also higher-order,

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,309
because it also operates on functions.

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,840
Namely, it can be seen as taking a
number and giving back a function.

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,640
So, it doesn't take a function as an
argument, but it has a function as a result.

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,799
But usually, we don't call a
function like this higher-order.

00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:56,872
Usually, with "higher-order" we say that
one of the arguments is a function.

00:27:56,872 --> 00:28:01,040
And, of course, this also fits with our
narrative that all functions are values.

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,600
A function is something that takes
something and gives back a value.

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,740
And this value can be a
function, like in this case.

00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,450
And then, this other syntactic specialty that
I already briefly used on the previous slide,

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,550
are the so-called "sections".

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,070
I did that on this example:

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:29,970
If we have a binary operator which is written
like this as a function, and then we provide

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:36,330
one argument, like the 5, then we can also write
it as basically: "I am an operator application

00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,890
where there is still missing one argument".

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,960
So, the first one is already there, but
the second part of "+" is still missing.

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:54,500
And I will, again, discuss this on
the next slide with a few notes.

00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,900
So, let's briefly talk about operator syntax.

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,820
Probably I have to do this first.

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,700
Known from other languages is that
there are prefix and infix operators.

00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,600
And in Haskell there is a special syntax for
writing an infix operator as prefix, and the

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,910
other way around.

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:20,630
What I did on one of the previous slides was
to write something like (+), and then I could

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,650
apply it to arguments like 5 and 7.

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,140
So, this is prefix because it
comes before the arguments.

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,490
And of course, also the usual functions like
the 'mod' function, or f, or "rectangle",

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,549
or typical functions that you have already
seen.

00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,300
So, they are usually written as prefix.

00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,330
It means that you have the function
and then you have two arguments.

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,890
Then there is infix syntax.

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,560
And that's for operators,
typically things like "1 + 2".

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,990
So, here, the "+" is an infix operator.

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,030
And you have also seen on the slides that
binary functions that would usually be written

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,890
prefix can also be written infix, if
you put them in these back-ticks `...`.

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,510
So, the "mod" is a binary function.

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,460
It can be written infix.

00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,670
And now these sections.

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:13,731
They apply to operators/functions that are
prefix, but that we want to use in a kind

00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:16,120
of infix style with just
one of two arguments given.

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,419
This is the "5 +" that you
saw on the previous slide.

00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:20,780
What was this?

00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:27,429
So, if we have a prefix function like the
"(+)", we can apply it to one of its arguments,

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:34,380
like 5, and then this also can be written
as this section "(5 +)" which means:

00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:42,330
I am a function that is waiting for an argument,
then I will compute "5 plus that argument".

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:49,690
We also have the other way around, where we
say: Let me write the section in this way.

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,650
So, we have this binary operator (+).

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,190
And I provide one of its
arguments, namely the second one.

00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:00,410
Then I get a function to which I can pass
a value, and then what is computed is that

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,930
value, which was passed last, plus 5.

00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:09,280
Of course, in the case of "plus",
this doesn't make a difference.

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,049
Semantically, this is of course
not an interesting difference.

00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:30,570
We will compute the same thing, assuming that
plus (+) is commutative, which at least on

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,570
the integers, it is.

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:38,380
But, for example, if we did
this with (-), so (5 -).

00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:46,900
This is also possible, because
(-) is a binary operator.

00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:54,809
And then, written as (- 5) [ACTUALLY, WOULD HAVE TO
WRITE (subtract 5) FOR THIS], they do different things.

00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,179
Why is that?

00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:09,630
Because one of them will wait for a value,
and then it will compute 5 minus that other

00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,640
value, and the other will wait for another
value, and then compute that value minus 5.

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:26,060
Simply, we will apply both of these two versions
to 7, and then you will see different outcomes.

00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:32,600
The first of these two functions
applied to 7 has the result -2.

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,880
The second, applied to 7, will result in 5.

00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,530
Because we could compute 7 - 5.

00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,530
Why is this useful?

00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,210
Is this all just somehow
syntactic games that we play?

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,020
Well, it often gives very nice, short,
declarative predicates, for example.

00:32:49,020 --> 00:33:12,070
In this case above here, it was arithmetic
functions, but, for example, it is also used

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:17,410
for predicates and properties.

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:33,299
So, for example, something like '< 5' is a
function from Int to Bool, because '<' is

00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:37,770
an operation between two
integers, 'Int → Int → Bool'.

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,990
And if I write '(< 5)', then it is a function
that is waiting for an argument, which could

00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,250
be 3 or 7 or whatever, and will return a Boolean,
namely, whether that thing is smaller than

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,250
5.

00:33:50,250 --> 00:34:05,850
So, if I apply the function you see here to 3,
the answer will be True, because 3 is smaller

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,850
than 5.

00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,190
Applying it to 7 would give False,
because 7 is not smaller than 5.

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,050
So, we simply read this as "smaller than five".

00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,190
It is doing exactly that.

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:23,690
And this is just nice syntax for that.

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,700
Let's think again about this (5 -) thing,
because this might still somehow worry you.

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:35,379
So, what is this (5 -)?

00:34:35,379 --> 00:35:06,680
So, this written above is a function waiting
for an argument x and then computing 5 – x.

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:16,520
And the same way for all the
other section syntax cases above.

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,380
Apart from the special syntax cases using
operators, we can also just syntactically

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,170
create new functions on the fly.

00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:30,700
So, instead of using predefined or our own explicitly
defined and named functions that are already

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,771
in the program, we could also (when we want
to pass a function to another function) simply

00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:37,520
create a new function at that point.

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,980
Such functions are called anonymous, and they
use the so-called lambda-abstraction syntax.

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,760
We have already seen this before, namely
in the context of QuickCheck tests.

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:55,140
There was this syntax, and I said something
like read this as "for all", but that was

00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,599
only applicable for the case of QuickCheck,
because there we want to have a predicate,

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,200
something that gave back a truth value.

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,440
And then, basically the interpretation of this
predicate was that for all x, the value here

00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
should hold.

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,240
But, in general, this is simply a function
which, given an x, computes something.

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,340
So, here we introduce an argument or maybe
several arguments (they can even be anonymous

00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,380
again, so we could use the '_'), and then
the whole thing that we have here is, in this

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,109
case, a function which,
given an x, computes x + x.

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:30,830
And we don't give a name to this function.

00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,900
So, we don't write a line
"function name = some expression".

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,400
Simply, this itself is a function,
which doesn't get its own name.

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,220
In that sense, it is anonymous.

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,780
And we can use it wherever we use functions,
for example, as arguments to our 'f' from a

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,940
few slides back.

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,690
To recap, discussing this example where we
had this 'f' which expected a function from

00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,980
Int to Int and gave back an Int:

00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,740
There are really many ways
in which we can use this.

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,530
The identity function (id) could be used here.

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,000
So, an existing library function
could be used as an argument.

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,740
And there are other ones that
work on integers, for example.

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:22,590
I just took some existing functions or partial
applications of functions from some libraries.

00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,510
Then this is something we have explicitly
discussed: that we can use operators, partially

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,890
apply them, and then get functions
that could have the appropriate type.

00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,330
We can pass an anonymous function.

00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,300
So, what I showed here: when we want to pass
this to f, then we have to put it in brackets

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,200
to make clear that this
is the argument to this f.

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,680
So, this goes in this place.

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,120
Then we could apply 'f' to this function.

00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,230
Or, of course, with the same syntax, we can
then write arbitrary expressions inside this

00:37:50,230 --> 00:38:01,840
body and create arbitrary anonymous functions.

00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,150
And actually, this lambda-abstraction syntax is
also another point where we can get a clearer

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,390
view on Haskell's function definition syntax.

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,810
Why it is the way it is.

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:17,180
We talked before about these two perspectives
on the function type 'Int → Int → Int', seeing

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,470
it as a function of two arguments that returns
an Int, or seeing it as a function that takes

00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,520
one Int and then returns another function.

00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:32,270
With lambda-abstraction syntax, we can
actually make this even more apparent.

00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,170
Let's look at this specific case here.

00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,640
Something like an 'add' function which takes
two integers and gives back an integer.

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,730
And then we can consider this to be the function
of addition, which takes two arguments and

00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,890
gives back their sum.

00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:54,490
Or, we could say: It is a function which takes
an argument x, and then returns a function;

00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,830
and we can explicitly write that one as a
function which is waiting for some argument

00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,670
and then returns the sum of the two.

00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,490
So, for these two, we could
use both these perspectives.

00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,780
This one, or the one where we have brackets
around here from a few slides back.

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,849
But they are equivalent, because these
two function definitions are equivalent.

00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,090
To have a function which takes two arguments
and gives back their sum is the same as a

00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,460
function which takes an argument and then
gives back a function which takes another

00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,510
argument and returns the sum of what
has been provided here and here.

00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,130
And we could even go to further extremes and
say:

00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,440
Actually, add is just something which is a
function which takes an x, and then returns

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,970
a function which takes a y, and
then returns the sum of these.

00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,950
We can even move the first argument to the
right-hand side, so that we have all arguments

00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,060
on the right-hand side.

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,849
And then, we can actually also shorten this
and, in lambda-abstraction syntax, directly

00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:50,030
introduce several variables at once.

00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:56,700
So, all these four ways are expressing the very
same thing and will be handled equivalently

00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,080
by the compiler.

00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:03,950
So, this explains, again, why we don't
use the standard mathematical notation.

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:09,360
Because if we had written addition as a function
like this, where we say: addition, and then

00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,380
brackets where we give it two arguments separated
by a comma, then it would not have been so

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,470
clear how to express these
different perspectives.

00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,920
We couldn't simply move from one to the other.

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,010
But in Haskell syntax, they are all equivalent,
because they capture the same mathematical

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,770
concept of function.

00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:33,050
This video is now getting really long.

00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,060
So, now I will finish with this slide.

00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,030
Now, some of you are maybe asking yourselves:

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,970
Is any of that really useful to us?

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:47,500
Because it looked all a bit esoteric, maybe,
because I had to introduce all these different

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,869
ways of writing functions
to pass to other functions.

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:58,330
It was all artificial so far, except maybe
for the things that I cannot explain to you

00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,450
now in inner details like "animationOf" and
"quickCheck" (the drivers of our libraries

00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:08,010
that we have been using), which you cannot
write yourself yet, in some parts because

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,599
they interact with 'IO' (like drawing
something on screen, for example).

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,890
That is something that you don't know how
to do right now, from first principles.

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,190
So, in that sense, even though you have seen
some higher-order functions, you cannot really

00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,120
write your own yet, or haven't,
maybe, seen a need for this.

00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,520
Hence, so far, this might seem a bit esoteric.

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,190
But some usages would be already apparent to
you maybe now, namely for example, in the

00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,300
exercise tasks where you
had to draw a game level.

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,370
Then what was the ingredient for this?

00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:50,180
It was the 'level' function which took two
integers and gave back a code for what tile

00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,530
to draw on the screen.

00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,930
And this 'level' function
could be seen as data itself.

00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,560
You could, for example, instead of having
it as a top-level definition, simply have

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,750
another function to which you
can give a "level" function.

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:12,060
And indeed, the current task from the exercises
where there were given several depictions

00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:19,190
of levels; that was realized by having, as
data, a list of levels, where a level is a

00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,190
function.

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,320
So, we had a list of functions.

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,350
And then that was given to a drawing function
which operated on this list of functions.

00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,940
So, there we had functions as data.

00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:35,980
Again, that is something that you haven't
written yourself, but very soon, actually

00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:42,250
in the next video, we will see more
examples of uses of higher-order.

00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:49,430
And we will do this in the case of lists,
because there are several directly useful

00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,510
higher-order functions on lists.

00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:58,070
Less esoteric than what I have shown you in
this video, where I first wanted to get through

00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:05,670
this basic concept of functions as arguments
to other functions and also provide certain

00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,869
syntactic prerequisites.

00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:14,089
Now, in the next video, we can use this to do
something useful on lists using higher-order

00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:14,589
functions.
