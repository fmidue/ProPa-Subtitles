00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:10,580
Now let us come to the video about higher-order
functions specifically for lists, as a more

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,460
interesting application than the artificial
examples I have shown you before when I wanted

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,660
to make the syntax available (and explain
it).

00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:28,239
So, I say on lists here, but as in previous
parts of the lecture, this is just for examples'

00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,239
sake.

00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,520
Similar functions to the ones I'm going to
show you now (and you're going to use in the

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,809
next exercises, probably) are
available for other datatypes as well.

00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:42,149
So, lists are just a stand-in, here,
for generally structured datatypes.

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,690
And this approach of using higher-order functions,
defining higher-order functions and working

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,460
with them is valid and useful for other data
types as well: for trees or other things that

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,339
are yet to come or will not even be covered in
this lecture, but that are useful in practice.

00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:06,630
So, lists, just because lists are so
simple, and we can directly use them.

117 # slide
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,439
Let's look at a first example, a
first higher-order function on lists.

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,380
This is this function that has
a somewhat strange name, maybe.

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,909
So, maybe it is not immediately
obvious why this is called 'foldl1'.

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,119
There is some systematics behind this because
there are other versions without the "1",

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,100
and there are versions with an
"r" instead of the "l" here.

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,399
Let's, for the moment, accept this strange
name and look at what the function does.

00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,159
And then later, we can discuss and
see what other versions there are.

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,880
So, what is this doing?

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,579
First, let's look at the type.

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,380
It is a polymorphic type.

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,700
And in that, we can, of course,
see the higher-order-ness here.

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,660
Because the first argument is a function,
namely, a binary function on some type.

00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,829
We have a type variable 'a' here.

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,460
So, "'a' to 'a' to 'a'" for whatever 'a' is.

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,640
So, for some type, we have
a binary function here.

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,030
And actually, down here, we also see that
it is expected to be left-associative (or

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:09,690
to be used in that way).

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,950
But that is not something
that the type expresses.

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,960
The type simply says that we have a binary
function and then we have a list of 'a's,

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,750
so, a list of elements of the kind
on which this function can operate.

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,280
And the outcome will also be one of those
things.

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
Well, not necessarily one of the elements
from that specific list, but something of

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,230
the same type as the things that we have in
the list (and the things that this function

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,500
can operate on).

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,250
And what does this function do?

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,800
This is not seen in the type
directly, but it is explained here.

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,000
So, it puts a function (an operator), namely
this one, which should be left-associative

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,840
(or be used left-associatively, as we will
see), and puts it between all elements of

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
a non-empty list.

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,980
So, we expect that this list is non-empty,
and this is actually what the "1" stands for.

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,170
The "l" stands for "left", and the
"1" stands for "at least one element".

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,500
We won't use this function for an empty list.

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,740
And the function puts an operator between all
elements of the non-empty list, in a left-associative

00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
fashion.

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
So, what does this mean?

00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Let's look at an example.

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,930
Let's say we want to compute the sum of a
list.

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,740
We have a list, say, of integers.

00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,050
So, then 'a' will be Int; and we have
a list; and we want to compute the sum.

00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,140
What does this mean?

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,500
Basically, taking a list and computing the
sum of it means to put the "+" symbol between

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,010
all neighboring elements.

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,970
So, we want to compute 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, which
is exactly what is explained here: putting

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,780
a certain operator there.

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,300
So, "+" is actually associative, so it
doesn't really matter how we bracket here.

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,091
For other operators like "-", of course, this
could make a difference, whether we are left-

00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:57,490
or right-associative; whether we consider
this to be computing this first, and then

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:03,490
this, and then for the whole list, or whether
we want to compute somehow differently, like

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,830
first this, then this, and
then the whole expression.

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,760
For "+", it doesn't matter.

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,620
So, computing the sum of a list, however long
it might be, is simply described by putting

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,310
a "+" between all neighboring elements.

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,380
If you recall our earlier discussion in the
previous week when we had this convenient

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,620
'sum' function and I said: even if we didn't
have the 'sum' function available on lists,

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,759
we could simply write it
with very few keystrokes.

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,129
Basically, these are the keystrokes that we
need.

00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,229
So, this is the 'sum' function.

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:39,770
It takes some list and puts "+"
between all neighboring elements.

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,569
That's what summing the elements of a list
means.

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,990
And the 'foldl1' function is polymorphic.

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,670
That's why we can use it so easily.

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,230
If we had something like a list of Boolean
values, then we cannot add them, but we can

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,600
maybe conjunct them, or disjunct
them, with 'and' and 'or'.

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,069
And then we can use the same polymorphic
function, just with a different operator here.

00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:09,150
We have polymorphism, and we have higher-order-ness,
and they combine to very nice uses here.

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,360
And we will see more functions of that kind, and
applications of this principle, this combination

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,699
of polymorphism and higher-order-ness.

118 # slide
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:25,050
Here is another example of a
higher-order function on lists.

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,050
And again, while as shown here it's a function
on lists, the same principle is applicable

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,050
to other data structures.

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,729
So, for other data structures that contain
elements of some type like trees, dictionaries,

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:44,289
or something not just list-structured, we
will also have a 'map' function, not with

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,749
exactly the same name, but with the same ideas.

00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,009
So, what does 'map' mean?

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,900
As written here, it's a polymorphic
function and it's a higher-order function.

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,360
It is parameterized over whatever function.

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,819
So, the argument here is very general.

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,270
It's a function from something to something.

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,659
So, 'a' and 'b' are possibly different types
(because they use different type variables).

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,979
And then what do we get?

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,849
The second argument is a list of
'a's and it returns a list of 'b's.

00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,449
What does the function do?

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,779
It applies this function to all elements of a
list and gives back a list with the changed

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,779
elements.

00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,779
Of course, they are not changed in place.

00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,939
We don't want to change this
list and turn the 'a's into 'b's.

00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:28,419
No, we give *in* a list of 'a's, and we get
*out* a list of 'b's which will be exactly

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:34,210
as long, but each element here is the result
of applying this function to the corresponding

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,210
element here.

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:42,050
So, we have now a new list which is a list
of 'b's and is the result of this function

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,770
(whatever was the first argument to the 'map'
call) on the corresponding elements from

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,169
here.

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,000
How could we use this?

00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,430
For example, we could call it with the
'even' predicate on some list of integers.

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,999
So, let's discuss what would happen here.

00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,999
The function 'even' goes from Int to Bool.

00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:10,039
In this case, 'a' would be Int and 'b' would
be Bool, which means that the second argument

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,990
should be a list of Ints, which is the case
here.

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,069
Then the outcome would be a list of Bools.

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,870
And, well, which Bools?

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,039
For each element here, we would apply the
'even' predicate, so checking whether the

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,189
number is even or not, and
accumulating the outcomes in the list.

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:29,590
So, the outcome of this call here
will be a list with 10 elements.

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,460
The first element is False
because "1" is not even.

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,529
The second element of the result will be True,
because the second element from this list

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,910
is "2", which is even, and so on.

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,780
We have False, True, False, True,
False, True, False, True, False, True.

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,079
Overall, 10 Boolean values.

00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,389
And each of them is the result of the check
for evenness of the corresponding element

00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,050
from the original list.

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,759
That is this line.

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,900
But of course, since the function is polymorphic,
we don't have to apply it to numbers or Booleans.

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,569
We can apply it, for example, to Pictures.

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,490
For example, 'a' and 'b' could both be instantiated
with Picture, then you would have to give

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,990
in a function from Pictures to Pictures.

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,699
Well, let's think of the CodeWorld library.

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,639
For example, 'dilated 5' is a
function from Pictures to Pictures.

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,800
Namely, it takes a Picture and scales it by
a factor of 5 in both x and y directions.

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,389
So, this is a partial application.

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,389
It's a function.

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,539
Actually, 'dilated' takes a number
and a Picture and gives a Picture.

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,560
So, if we apply it partially to just a number,
then we get a function from Picture to Picture.

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,440
That is something we can pass in
here, if 'a' and 'b' are both Picture.

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,150
Then we have to give a list of Pictures.

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,790
So, let's say we have three
Pictures: pic1, pic2, pic3.

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,330
Then we can pass this in.

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,630
And what would be the outcome?

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,910
Again, a list of Pictures because 'b'
will also be Picture in this case.

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,960
And what is the outcome list?

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,410
It's a list of three Pictures, which are these
three, but each of them is scaled in both

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,030
x and y direction by 5.

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:06,000
This is expressing: take this list of Pictures,
and for each of them, scale in this way.

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,390
And that is a very brief way to express this.

119 # slide
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,390
And another example:

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,120
The so-called 'filter' function.

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,390
A slightly different type.

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,620
What are the ingredients now?

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,710
Again, we have a function.

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,220
But now it's not a function from
'a' to some 'b' (to anything).

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,170
It's a function of type from 'a' to Bool.

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,390
So, it is a predicate.

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,370
The 'a' is still polymorphic.

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,330
But the outcome of this function
type is specifically Bool.

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,180
Which was allowed in the previous case with
the 'map' function, but it was not enforced

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,180
there.

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,340
There, 'b' could be anything.

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,710
Then, again, we get a list of 'a's, so, of the
things to which this predicate (this function)

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,010
can be applied.

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,110
And the outcome is a list of 'a's.

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,120
Previously, it was a list of 'b's because we
outputted the results of applying the function

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,210
to elements from here.

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,390
Now for the 'filter' instead of the 'map'
function, we instead return a list of 'a's.

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,390
Which 'a's are this?

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,370
Which 'a' elements will this be?

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,600
The ones from this list which satisfy whatever
predicate is given here (whatever function

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,940
from 'a' to Bool is given here).

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,380
So, this could be a shorter list than this
one, because some elements from this list

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,130
might not satisfy this predicate,
and then they are discarded.

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,150
Let's think about using this
with the 'even' predicate again.

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,480
In the previous slide, I had 'map' and 'even'
and [1,2,...,10], and then the outcome was

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,810
[False, True, False, True, ...].

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,780
Ten elements to ten Boolean values, namely,
False, True, etc., because 1 is not even,

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,350
but 2 is even, 3 is not even, etc.

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,310
What would happen if we
apply 'filter' and 'even'?

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,720
What does it say?

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,750
Take the elements from that list
[1..10] which satisfy the predicate.

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:59,690
So, the ones to which the function
applied gives False would now not be kept.

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,800
So, we don't keep 1, 3, 5, etc.

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,070
The other ones are kept.

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,580
And we don't output True for them
because we don't output Bool.

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,270
The output is the elements themselves.

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:16,260
So, while "map even [1..10]" gives [False,
True, False, True, ...], "filter even [1..10]"

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
gives [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,150
We get the list of numbers
that satisfy the predicate.

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,560
This was one example, with the 'even' predicate.

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,470
We can think of other examples.

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,800
Let's take the 'isPalindrome' function that we
used in the slides (and you also programmed

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,980
a version of it in the exercises).

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,240
And let's say we have a
"completeDictionary" as a list of Strings.

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,270
And we want to know which of the words
in our dictionary are palindromes.

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,680
We simply have to filter that complete
dictionary by this isPalindrome predicate.

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,700
So, this would be a list of Strings, and 'isPalindrome'
is a function from String to Bool, so the

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,560
outcome would be again a list of Strings,
namely, only those words from the dictionary

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,730
that are palindromes.

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:10,970
Or let's say we have something like "bonusPercentageList"
as Double values, and we want to keep only

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,750
those that are greater than 50%.

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,910
Then we could pass this section, this
anonymous function, to the 'filter' function.

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,280
So, the predicate would be from Double to Bool
(because that is exactly what this is doing:

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,420
checking for a Double whether it's greater
than 0.5), this would be a list of Doubles

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,760
(the bonusPercentageList), and the outcome
would be a possibly shorter list of Doubles,

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,620
namely, only those kept
that are greater than 50%.

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:49,360
And again, when I say "It selects list elements",
that doesn't mean it changes this list.

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
This is a list that comes in.

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
It is the input.

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,410
And out comes another list, which is probably, in
most cases, a bit shorter because some elements

00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,410
will not be selected.

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,000
So, we don't delete something from the list.

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,370
We give back a new list that has fewer elements.

120 # slide
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,070
Now we could ask ourselves how
'map' and 'filter' are defined.

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:18,470
Actually, you should be able to
come up with this on your own.

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,620
Namely, 'map' and 'filter', applying a function
to each element of a list or selecting elements

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:29,040
from a list according to some predicate/property;
that was exactly what we have been using list

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
comprehension for so far.

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,460
Indeed, you could think of what you see on
this slide as the definitions of 'map' and

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,460
'filter'.

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,200
The 'map' function takes a function,
takes a list, and what does it do?

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,660
It selects each element from the list, applies
f to it, and accumulates the outcomes in a

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
list.

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,990
This is not actually how 'map' is defined
in the standard library because there are

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,690
different and more general ways to do this
(which will also be applicable to other types,

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,690
as I mentioned).

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,330
But for the specific case of lists, you could
think of 'map' as being defined like this.

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,290
So, whenever, so far, we wrote something like
this, we could also have used the 'map' function.

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,459
You couldn't have used that sometimes because
that was excluded from the exercise tasks.

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,370
But from now on, where
appropriate, you can use this.

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,630
And similarly 'filter', about
selecting things from a list.

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,670
That is also something we have done so far
with list comprehensions with these guard

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:32,490
expressions saying: I take each element from
a list that satisfies a predicate (something

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,141
like "even a", for example),
and then the 'a' is kept.

00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:41,350
This is exactly as described
for the 'filter' function.

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:48,550
So, 'map' and 'filter' are somehow replacements
for certain kinds of list comprehensions,

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,550
at least.

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,090
And that is a way to maybe remember, and better
understand these functions from your perspective

00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,710
now, because you already
know list comprehensions.

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:04,730
But also the opposite is true, namely: conversely,
every list comprehension expression, no matter

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,660
how complicated (maybe using several generators,
more than one guard expression, etc.), can

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,230
be implemented with 'map' and 'filter', and
actually, we might use the 'concat' function

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,860
in addition (which was introduced earlier).

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,190
It is not a higher-order function.

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,560
It is a polymorphic function that
basically flattens list levels.

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,680
So, if we have a list of lists of 'a's, then
'concat' gives us a list of 'a's by concatenating

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,430
all the inner lists.

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,780
And if you have 'map', 'filter', and 'concat',
then you don't need list comprehensions anymore.

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,500
Because whatever you could express with even
complicated list comprehension expressions

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,590
can also be expressed with
'map', 'filter', and 'concat'.

00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,871
And indeed, that is what the compiler does.

00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:52,530
So, if in your Haskell code you use list comprehensions,
then at some point during the compilation

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:58,310
process, they essentially get replaced by
expressions involving 'map', 'filter', and 'concat'.

121 # slide
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:06,920
Given this relationship to list comprehensions,
a further question might be whether if we

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,050
now switch from list comprehensions to 'map'
and 'filter' (and maybe 'foldl1' and other

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,180
similar functions), is this still wholemeal
programming in the sense discussed in the

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,850
last week?

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,590
So far, my examples of wholemeal programming
were about using list comprehensions instead

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,140
of explicit recursion or
instead of list indexing.

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,940
So, now, if I go to 'map' and 'filter' and
other higher-order functions, is this still

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,210
wholemeal programming?

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,190
Yes, absolutely!

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,090
In some sense, even more so.

00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,760
Since these higher-order functions provide a
first step in the direction of more abstraction.

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,040
As I said, they are available for
other data structures as well.

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,190
List comprehensions are for lists.

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,420
So, if we want to do wholemeal programming
on lists, we can use list comprehensions.

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,760
What about other data structures?

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,930
If we have trees or generally not just lists,
but some more structured data structures?

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,710
Then we won't have list comprehensions
anymore, because they are about lists.

00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,399
But these 'map' and 'filter' and similar functions,
they are available for other datatypes as

00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,399
well.

00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:12,639
Then we can think about wholemeal
programming on other types as well.

00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:21,049
And this is actually a benefit
of this more general perspective.

00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,680
Discussing this on lists with the 'map' and
'filter' versions for lists, I actually want

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,510
to discuss a short example.

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,559
So, let me first read it here, what the aim
is.

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,720
And then we can look at basically two solutions,
with list comprehensions and with 'map' and

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,409
'filter', and discuss the comparison.

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:49,320
In a similar way to when I compared for-loops
to list comprehension expressions, when I

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,860
discussed C versus Haskell in the previous
week.

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,421
So, what do we want to do here?

00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:59,639
We have some numbers in a list.

00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,340
We want to square them.

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,509
But we want to do that subject to the condition
that we are interested in numbers divisible

00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,720
by 4.

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,630
But what do we mean by "We are
interested in numbers divisible by 4"?

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,889
We are not yet clear.

00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:20,539
Is it that we want to make sure that
we only square numbers divisible by 4?

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:26,200
Or do we want to check that after we square
the numbers, they are divisible by 4?

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,029
That's a subtle difference.

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,370
And we want to experiment with both versions.

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,980
And we want to look at what does it mean to
express this with list comprehensions (both

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,970
ways), and with 'map' and 'filter'.

122 # slide
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:43,970
Let's look at this.

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,080
Here are two list comprehension
expressions for the two cases.

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,799
What is the first line saying?

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,659
It says: I have a list, I take every element
from the list, I check whether it is divisible

00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:01,509
by 4; and if so, I keep it and square it.

00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,179
This is one of the two versions.

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:09,799
This is the version where I only square
numbers which are divisible by 4.

00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,440
And the other version is: I decide that what I
want is that the square numbers are divisible

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
by 4.

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,840
So, I want to take the numbers from the list,
and to square them (just in case, to be prepared

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,039
to check them), and I do not check the x for
divisibility by 4, but the y (which is the

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,169
square of x).

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,360
And only if this passes, then I keep the y.

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,279
These are the two versions.

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,360
And I have to do some work to
switch from one to the other.

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,860
It is not an obvious transformation from
here to there, or from here to there.

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,850
And the only difference conceptually is:

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,440
Do I want to square those
things which are divisible by 4?

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,610
Or do I want to square things and
the outcome should be divisible by 4?

00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,710
This leads to quite different code.

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,750
Well, it is not completely different code, but
I had to rearrange this list comprehension.

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,230
What is the message here if I do this,
instead, with 'map' and 'filter'?

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,370
It becomes more symmetric, in a way.

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,960
Writing this with 'map' and
'filter', what would I do?

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,070
Well, the first version is: I want to look at
all the values from the original list which

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,179
are divisible by 4; then I want to square
them.

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,750
But how can I express this?

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,929
I can use function composition, which I introduced
in the previous whiteboard video, and compose

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,480
two functions, namely uses of 'filter' and
'map'.

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,399
The 'filter' function is the one which will
make the job of only keeping the elements

00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,409
which are divisible by 4.

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,169
That's what will happen here.

00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,769
And afterwards, I will square the elements
in the list which I have at this point after

00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:49,769
filtering.

00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:54,660
This is, again, section syntax: the function
that takes something and squares it.

00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,140
So, this corresponds to the first line here.

00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,039
And to the second line corresponds what?

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:06,190
Well, here I want to say: I want to square
elements in a list, and I want to only keep

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,619
those where the square is divisible by 4.

00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:14,380
This, simply, means to switch the order of
the constituents of this function composition.

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,400
Now, I first apply 'map' to square
each element of my given list.

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,080
So, these two expressions will, of
course, be applied to this list.

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,230
These are functions after composition.

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,490
They are composing functions into a function.

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,940
And then, this whole expression, this one
or this one, would be applied to a list.

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,960
When we do this here, this list will have
each element squared, and afterwards we will

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,230
filter for divisibility by 4.

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,940
So, here, on this level of expression, it simply
means to swap the order of function composition.

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:53,139
Whereas on the somewhat lower level of list
comprehensions, we needed more transformation

00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:56,250
of syntax to switch from
one version to the other.

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:03,570
In that sense, this is a nicer and more general
way of expressing manipulation of lists or

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,570
list elements.

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,659
This is also fine, of
course, list comprehensions.

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:17,640
But this is more pleasing
from an algebraic perspective.

123 # slide
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:26,640
And interestingly, also when it comes to expressing
algebraic laws, this perspective of higher-order

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,779
functions becomes more general
and maybe also more useful.

00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:38,960
So, let's recall this law that we mentioned a while
back, about 'reverse' and list comprehensions.

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,809
Actually, it was discussed already that thanks
to polymorphism, we can also put other completely

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,529
polymorphic functions on lists in this place.

00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:54,679
And we said something like: 'reverse' of a
list comprehension where we apply a function

00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,759
to each element from a given list (and then
reversing), is the same as doing the same

00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,980
but on the reversed list, and then not
having the ultimate 'reverse' call.

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,029
And now that we know that this is basically a
'map' call, we can express this with function

00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:13,940
composition, by saying: "reverse after map f
is the same as map f after reverse".

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,230
It uses reverse/reverse.

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,850
It uses the expression of this
list comprehension by map.

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:24,870
And of course, this is also a 'map' call,
namely, on the outcome of 'reverse'.

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:31,120
And then, if we also use function composition
(this mathematical notion), then we can actually

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,960
say: "reverse after map is the
same as map after reverse".

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,190
This is also very nice to remember.

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,759
And if we also know that this can be replaced
by other polymorphic functions, we get a very

00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,220
general law.

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:51,299
And since map can also be similarly defined
on other data structures, and polymorphic

00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,340
functions exist on other data structures, we
can have the same kind of result then also

00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,350
for other things than lists.

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:03,309
Which wouldn't be clear how to express if we
want to generalize from these list comprehensions

00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,529
to some other datatype.

00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,980
Because list comprehension syntax
does not exist for other datatypes.

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,320
But 'map' and polymorphic functions do.

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,649
So, that's one thing, that we
can express laws like this.

00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:17,179
Then, of course, we can also ask ourselves:
what about other higher-order functions?

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,929
Do they also satisfy such laws?

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,379
So, for example, we could ask ourselves:

00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,750
Now we have 'map' and 'filter',
do they also commute in some way?

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,039
If I have a map-call and a filter-call,
can I also exchange the order of these?

00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,239
The answer is: not always.

00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:35,419
We also have to take into account that maybe
these need to be different predicates, because

00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,200
the f might change the type of the list elements.

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,049
So, it is not even clear that p
and q could have the same types.

00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,410
So, certainly, they are not
simply the same predicate.

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,519
But maybe there is some
relationship between them.

00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:52,690
Actually, I would invite you to think a bit
about this, because this will improve your

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,441
understanding of what 'map'
and 'filter' are doing.

00:24:55,441 --> 00:25:03,440
I am not going to discuss this now,
but it's a nice thing to consider.

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,960
And generally, it can be said and observed
that higher-order functions are themselves

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,529
a boon, are of benefit, for this
idea of lawful program construction.

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:20,249
Remember the quote by Richard Bird that I
started the wholemeal programming lecture

00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,869
with (in last week's lectures).

00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:28,139
So, we come full circle here.

00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:33,799
Since these higher-order functions are a good
replacement for list comprehensions, and a

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:41,510
good way of writing wholemeal programs, it
makes sense that they have nice properties,

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,529
nice laws, and can be used
for program construction.

00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:48,870
For designing programs from ideas about
algebraic properties, for example.

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:55,299
Again, this is not something we are going to
do here, but that you might see in action

00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,970
when you see some of the examples
and think about how they are related.
