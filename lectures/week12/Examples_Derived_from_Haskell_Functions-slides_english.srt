00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,800
Welcome back.

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
In this video, we will talk
about more Prolog examples.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,480
So far, we have seen examples of the form where
we had some constant entities, like the persons in

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
most of the examples you've seen so far, or
maybe almost all the examples you've seen so far.

00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,640
And then predicates were used to express

00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,280
to capture relationships between these
entities, between these constants.

00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,320
And then facts and rules were used to describe

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
what is the nature of those relationships
or which relationships do hold.

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
And this was the kind of Prolog
program you have seen so far.

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,840
Okay, today, we will see other Prolog
programs, which work with structured data.

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,880
So, you have already seen the
terminology in the previous video

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,200
about how terms are written in Prolog,

00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,320
and how this corresponds in
spirit to trees in Haskell.

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,520
We will see more of this today by looking
at programs over such structured data.

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
And in particular, indeed, we will look
at the relationship to Haskell programs.

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,640
So, you will see something that
would be a function in Haskell,

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,000
how this could be spelled out in
a predicate and rules in Prolog.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,800
And even in some semi-automatic way, how to

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,960
make the corresponding Prolog
program for a Haskell program.

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Of course, there is no sort
of one-to-one fit exactly.

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,160
Because of differences like the type system, et
cetera, but to have in spirit such a relationship.

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,840
And then from this, you can also see that with
the Prolog program, we obtain such a way we can do

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,760
a few more things than just with
a Haskell program because of this

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,320
logical flavor and predicate definitions
instead of function definitions.

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,960
Okay, but let's, before I talk more
about this, actually look at an example.

31 # slide
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,720
So, let's assume you want to
work with data structures.

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,840
And our first data structures are simply numbers.

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,400
But not 0, 1, 2 in terms
of a built-in integer type.

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,560
But in a similar fashion in which we used
natural numbers in Haskell as an example for data

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,320
structures where we expressed things with a zero
constructor and then a successor constructor.

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,960
So, the successor of the
successor of zero would be two.

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,360
So, let's say, we want to do
something similar in Prolog.

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,640
And well, we would want to express a function,
something plus something is something else.

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,320
So, two inputs, one output.

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,960
Of course, that's not something that
fits the pattern of Prolog programs.

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,080
Because as I said several times already,

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,520
in Prolog, we don't write functions
that can be evaluated to results.

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,800
We don't build expressions that evaluate, but
instead, we write something like a query.

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Write first a program, then
a query against that program,

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,120
in which we try to express
things like something satisfied.

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
And if you want to have an outcome, then

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,600
that works by having a variable in a query
and then the query is made satisfiable.

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,240
And the values, the instantiations for

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,560
any occurring variables, while
making the query satisfiable.

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
That would be considered our output.

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,240
Okay, so instead of having a binary function
addition, we can only have a predicate.

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,040
So, there is a certain convention that is not
enforced with the language, but I will use it.

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,520
And it's also often used actually in examples.

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,920
So, if I have a binary function, then I can
turn this into a predicate of three arguments.

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,840
And the idea is if I write something
like that, like add zero, something,

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,960
something, then this means that this plus
this, so the addition of these two things,

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,280
is supposed to be the filtered
thing, the third argument.

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,640
So, what this could be read as
is zero, so the addition of zero

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,880
and X is X for any X, which
makes perfect sense, right?

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,680
And here you already see differently
from, for example, Haskell that we can

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,800
use the same variable several times
in the head of a rule or in a fact.

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Okay, I mentioned this already that

00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,840
there are fewer restrictions on the
form of a program line than in Haskell.

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
Okay, so the addition of zero and X is X
for whatever X is, that makes perfect sense.

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,600
Okay, of course, this would only allow us to

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,840
have very simple additions, then we
could only add zero and something.

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
So, instead, we also need another rule.

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,120
A recursive rule probably, and one
possibility for this rule is that without,

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
actually several ones, but one would be this.

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,560
So, let's read this.

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
So, here I use the s as successor.

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,920
So, I used the normal zero for zero case and
s of something for that s of zero is one.

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,800
s of s of zero is two, et cetera.

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
Okay, and then what I'm saying
here, in the second rule, is:

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,200
It is true that the successor of
X plus Y is the successor of Z.

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,680
If it is also the case, if it's already
the case that X plus Y is Z, or

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,360
right the other way around if
the addition of X and Y is Z,

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,320
then the addition of the successor
of X and Y is the successor of Z.

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,160
Again, this makes perfect
sense as a logical statement.

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,600
Then we can use it in queries.

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,760
So, for example, we can ask Prolog whether it is
the case that the addition of one and one is two.

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,440
Yes, that's what this now means, because s
of zero will be interpreted by us as one.

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,160
Okay, what will Prolog say?

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
Well, Prolog will say, yes.

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,040
Okay.

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,640
And we cannot only ask questions that have
a true or false answer, we can also ask

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,440
questions where we want to see some result.

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,520
And we do this by replacing, in this case, the
simplest choice would be to replace the last

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,120
term here by a variable and then we are not
asking if the addition one plus one equals two.

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
But we are asking, is there a number
which is the addition of one plus one?

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
And by the way, if it is, tell me which it is.

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,120
Okay, so we can ask is there an N such
that the addition of one and one is N?

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
And now Prolog should not just answer true.

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
It should say, yes, it is.

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,320
And yes, actually instantiation and again these
rules, these are basically the Peano axioms of

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,080
addition on natural numbers.

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,760
So, there is a unique solution.

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,440
And that's the one you would also expect.

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,440
Okay, that's a first Prolog
program on data structures.

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
And then, of course, corresponds

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,920
very closely up to the modular syntax
differences to this Haskell function.

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,720
Yes, that occurred in this or very similar form

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
earlier in the Haskell part of
the lecture where we model natural

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,840
numbers with such a datatype with zero
constructor and a successor constructor.

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,800
So, here in Prolog, since I don't have a type
system, I can be free to actually use the

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
number value zero instead
of the zero constructor.

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,800
Whereas in Haskell, I have to choose its data
type and then stick to name choices here.

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
And then the program something like the
addition of zero and X is X, and the

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,320
addition of the successor of X and Y is
the successor of the addition of X and Y.

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,280
Yes, this corresponds in spirit at least to these

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,280
two Prolog rules, in fact, and actually,
we can compute the same thing, right?

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,400
If we use this addition function in Haskell and give
it the successor of zero, the successor of zero,

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,640
it will give the successor
of the successor of zero.

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Okay, so what's the
correspondence more closely here?

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
Well, apart from just this one example,
where it looks somewhat similar.

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,240
But also different, of course.

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
Because here we have two inputs and one output.

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
And here, we simply have three arguments.

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
So, let's make this a bit more
systematic on the next slide.

32 # slide
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,720
So, what's the difference?

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Or the connection?

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Can we even derive one version from the other?

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,320
So, let's look well in Haskell we have functions.

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,560
Of course, that's the thing that I
have stressed all the time in Prolog,

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
instead, we have predicates or relations.

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,040
So, we're not talking about functions, we're
talking about things that can be true, or relations

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,680
that are either true or not true for certain
combinations of some variables from certain sets.

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,040
Okay, so where in Haskell we write
things like f of x and y is z.

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,800
So, you have two inputs and an output.

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,160
Now in Prolog instead, this would
correspond to where we had a predicate,

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,240
which has three arguments.

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,920
And we might interpret this as

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,880
being somehow expressing that Z is a
result of doing something with X and Y.

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,040
But actually, more generally, this is
just a predicate that has three things.

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,240
As there is no inherent
input-output distinction here,

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,200
these are just three arguments and
the predicate can be true or not.

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Whereas here we have certain inputs and an
output, they are syntactically distinguished.

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay, this vanishes on the Prolog side,
except maybe if we have a convention

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
where we say that we always consider the
last argument to be the output or something.

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,080
Okay, so with this correspondence, that could
also already be used maybe to translate a

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Haskell program to a Prolog program, yes.

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,200
So, if you see an equation like
this, add of zero and x is x,

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
then we could say well then by this correspondence
here this means, on the Prolog side,

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
we have to have a predicate add, which takes
three arguments and where we use zero, x, x.

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,640
And then, of course, there are some syntactic
differences like the fact that in Prolog,

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,640
variables are uppercase and
constructors are lowercase or symbols.

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
There is also the difference, of course, that in

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,360
Haskell we don't use the parentheses and
commas for arguments, you have just space.

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
Yes, but that's the non-mathematical
way that the Haskell-specific

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
way of writing down an application.

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,680
This is more in line with how mathematics
has been doing it for a long time, right?

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,480
Okay, but there is a difference in the lexical
syntax of the variables and constructors.

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
So, let's fix this.

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Then this would correspond to
this that I already mentioned,

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,240
I can replace the zero data constructor
with just the value, the digit zero.

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
Of course, anyway, there's
no type system that would

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
prevent me from doing this and require me
to introduce an extra datatype for this.

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,320
And I replaced the variables by
Prolog syntax variables in uppercase.

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,560
Okay, then I have translated essentially my first
rule to Prolog, my first equation to Prolog.

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,880
Okay.

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
And I also do some kind of
pattern-matching, right?

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,160
Where again in Haskell I had this
matching against the zero here.

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Now we have a match in the first
argument against this constant.

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
Yes, where the other two
places are just variables.

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,840
So, there is nothing to compare
against, except for them being equal.

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,312
Okay, does this also work for the other equation?

00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:14,960
Yes, the more interesting
equation from the Haskell

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,720
program that would look something like
this or that looks something like this.

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, how would this correspond along this
line here to something on the Prolog side?

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720
Well, one could naively think: that probably
means something like, well, the addition of

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:39,040
the first argument successor of x, second argument
y, outcome successor of this expression here.

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
And then I fix up the x and
y to be uppercase, et cetera?

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,760
And then maybe I'm already done.

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,760
Well, not quite.

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,900
Why not?

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,720
Well, because what we see
here, that isn't something that

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,400
would make sense on the Prolog side.

00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,600
Yes.

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
So, we haven't translated all
function applications to predicates.

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,520
Yes, I simply leave this right-hand
side here then, it doesn't make sense.

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,560
Yes, here I have addition as a ternary predicate,
and here, suddenly, it's still a function

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
which isn't reasonable in Prolog, right?

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,400
And the reason is that Prolog basically
doesn't have nested function application.

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,760
If I express everything as predicates over
some arguments, then if I have something that

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,640
has to be nested, then I need
to chain the predicate somehow.

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,200
I cannot simply say, I put add x y
here, because that would be a function.

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,520
But if I have just predicates, then I could
have something like addition of x and y

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,200
is something else, but I can't write an expression
add x, y, and please compute the z for me?

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
Okay, that simply doesn't make sense.

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,920
I haven't applied this consistently here.

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
Okay, what can we do instead?

33 # slide
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,080
Well, we have to somehow systematically
avoid these nested function calls.

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
So, the first question there would
be, how would we do this in Haskell?

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,080
If in Haskell, we would also not be
allowed to have nested function calls?

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,640
Could we do something about this?

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,840
Well, with some thinking, yes, we could.

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
If in Haskell, we would not be allowed to write

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,480
an expression like this nested inside
another function or inside a constructor

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,520
call, then we could use local definitions
to reflect over to avoid this.

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,760
So, this is, of course, equivalent, on the
Haskell side, to an equation like this.

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
The addition of the successor of
x and y is the successor of z,

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
where z is the addition of x and y.

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Okay, why would I want to do this?

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,400
Well, because if I do this, then
I avoid this nested function call.

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,320
Now we have just a variable here,

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
which is a completely different thing
than a nested function call, right?

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,880
That's something that I can
easily put into a form like this.

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,080
And this actually is also something
I can put into a form like this,

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,680
because it corresponds really to a
function application and the result.

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,840
Whereas this was something strange,
which makes sense on the Haskell side,

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,600
but not on the predicate Prolog side.

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,800
Okay, so let's say on the Haskell
side, we do something like this.

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,080
Then, what does this give us?

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,040
Well, you could read this, of course,
as the addition of the successor of x

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,280
and y, is the successor of z if the
addition of x and y is z, right?

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,800
Because that's exactly what this is saying.

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,280
If z or where z is the result of this function
call that means the same as saying well,

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
z is the addition of x and y.

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,000
And if so, if we choose z such that
this holds, then also this holds.

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay, and by doing this trick, we
have actually expressed our Haskell

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,680
equation as something that makes sense in
terms of implication, and predicate invocation.

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,560
Right?

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,040
This looks much more like Prolog than this does.

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,160
Well, we only have to fix up the syntax again.

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,560
Yes, if we have to replace the if by the actual
Prolog syntax for implication, you have to

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,160
fix up the lexical syntax, namely
that variables need to be uppercase.

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,520
And for good measure, I also change the
data constructors that were written like

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:30,000
this in Haskell into lowercase constructors
and for brevity, I simply use s here.

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Of course, I could also have written succ.

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,840
Okay, then this will be the used for
rendering of this statement here, which was

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,520
basically a reformulation of
this nested function call.

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
Okay, so I end up with a program
I already showed you before.

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,800
But now, it's most systematically
obtained from a Haskell program.

34 # slide
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
Okay, here it is again.

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Now, why would I do this?

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,720
Why would I go through the trouble to take my nice
small Haskell function translated into a Prolog

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,240
rule system, so that I can then do the
same thing I could do in Haskell before.

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
Well, there is a benefit of doing this.

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:25,520
Well, apart from now being able to write Prolog
programs, which comes with its own incentives.

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,920
Well, even on this small example, we
can see something about the flexibility

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
of Prolog predicates.

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
Why is that?

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,800
Well, what I just did is I took a Haskell
function, which is input-output based.

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
I translated this into a Prolog predicate.

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,720
Then on the Prolog side, I may
have the convention that I always

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,040
input two things and get the third thing
out, but actually there's nothing in the

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
syntax of Prolog that requires me
to interpret a program like that.

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,200
Well, this program is simply stating a
fact, or facts, about three arguments.

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,480
Whether or not they are related, whether three
numbers have the property that the first two,

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
when we add them, give the third one.

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,920
So, there's nothing that keeps us in
queries from using this differently.

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,320
So, instead of simply asking, well, what is
the addition of some fixed number and some

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,440
other fixed number, we could also ask: Well, what
are some N and M such that the addition is two?

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Yes, we have written an addition function
that translates into a Prolog predicate.

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,360
And now we can ask questions
about this predicate,

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,800
that wouldn't be easily answered by
just a Haskell function we saw before.

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,560
In the Haskell function, we can't say,
here's my output, give me the inputs.

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,680
On the Prolog side, since there wasn't
any difference between inputs and outputs,

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,560
I can say, well, once I
have this definition here,

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,840
I can ask well, are there some N and
M such that the addition would be two?

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
And well, we can simply ask
Prolog what it will do with this.

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
And it will actually happily
provide some answers.

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
It will say yes, indeed, there is.

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,920
So, for example, zero plus two is two.

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,520
And then as a user, I can ask, well,
is this really the only choice?

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
Give me maybe further options.

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,240
And then Prolog would say,
well, one plus one is also two.

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,320
And indeed, if we asked further, then it would
also tell us that two plus zero is also two.

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,600
Right?

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,800
So, what this means is we have programmed an
addition function in the form of a predicate,

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,320
and then we can suddenly use
it in the backward fashion.

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,800
In some sense, we are doing
subtraction here, right?

00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:32,480
Or at least, separating a number into
its two summands, all possible choices.

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,040
Yes, we get several solutions here.

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,520
Where asking a Haskell function
doesn't even make sense.

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,320
To a Haskell function, we give two
inputs and we expect the output.

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,280
One exactly, exactly one output.

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,120
Okay.

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
Whereas here we have further choice, right?

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,640
You could also say something like, what
is the N such that N plus one is two?

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
So, what's the predecessor of two?

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
Well, then Prolog will say,
well, the answer is this.

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
So, here, we have indeed, turned the
addition predicate into basically

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,080
a subtraction because it's the same as
asking, well, what is two minus one?

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,600
Okay. And then we can also
become overambitious and

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
ask ourselves: Well, what if I
call this just with variables?

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes, I write the concrete program, which
expresses when two numbers added together

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,040
give a certain number, and then I ask Prolog: Well, what
are N, M, O such that the addition of N and M is O?

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Okay, so we will not consider this right now.

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
So, if we were to do this,
then you would see that

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,280
sometimes not all the possible ways
to use a predicate are equally useful.

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
But well, these first two
here are certainly useful.

35 # slide
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,120
Indeed, the case from the example

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
where I basically kept the outcome and one of the
summands fixed and asked for the other summand.

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,240
I said, that's like subtraction, where we can
even make this explicit as a program, right?

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,320
We can say well, we have written our
addition function in the form of a predicate.

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
And then I want to say what subtraction is.

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,400
And instead of writing a separate program
for subtraction, which also has some

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,560
pattern-matches for zero case, non-zero
case, et cetera, I simply say, well,

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,840
the subtraction of X and Y is Z if, and
indeed, if and only if, Z plus Y is X, right?

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,600
So, this expresses a relationship
between addition and subtraction.

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,440
And just by doing this I, for free,
get a subtraction predicate, which

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,600
computes subtractions.

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
That's not something that you can do in Haskell.

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,600
Write an addition function, and then simply say,
well, subtraction is the opposite or the reverse.

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,560
That's not something you can do.

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,640
You have to write a separate
subtraction function.

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
Here in Prolog, on the logical level
you have addition defined logically.

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,160
And by the way, X minus Y is Z if
it is the case that Z plus Y is X,

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
and then we can use this to subtract.

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,160
Even though we haven't explicitly
influenced a subtraction.

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,680
Can I ask what is two minus one?

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,640
And the answer would be one.

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Or you could also ask, for example, what
are N and M such that N minus M is one?

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,860
Yes.

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,560
There are very many possible solutions here.

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,960
Right?

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
For example, two and one.

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,640
So, N being two and M being
one would be a possible answer.

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
Because then we have two minus one is one.

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,080
But actually, Prolog is even cleverer here.

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,920
Prolog will answer something like this

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,000
to tell us yes, there are choices for
N and M such that N minus M is one.

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,120
And what are these choices?

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,160
Well, every choice where N is the successor of M.

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,640
So, this expresses in a finite way, infinitely
many pairs which satisfy this predicate.

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
Again, something that wouldn't work in Haskell.

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,840
Because there you don't
get such symbolic answers.

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,840
You can only give concrete
inputs and get a concrete output.
