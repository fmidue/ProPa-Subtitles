112 # slide
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
In the last example, just in the past
video I used lists. Namely, I had

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:16,680
there the list of already visited intermediate
stations stored in this transitive hull example with

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,320
possible cycles between the cities and
their connections, i.e. cyclic connections.

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,320
I had mentioned lists before, only very
briefly once at one place. Namely, when it was

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,930
about the types of data we can
work with in Prolog. There we had

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,960
started with constants. Then we had learned
that there are these data constructors,

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,400
from which you can create data structures.
So, we had done that with s/1 and z/0.

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,580
s(s(z)) for example as a representation for a
symbolic number 2. And on the slide where they

00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,820
first appeared, I had also mentioned that there was
list syntax. That we can represent lists in Prolog.

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,350
So, for example, something like a [1,2,3,4,5]
with square brackets and commas in between.

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,870
And that this works just as well not
only for numbers but with any other data.

00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,450
So, we can have atoms in there. We can also
have variables in there. We can also mix them.

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,680
We could also have such s(s(z)) terms
in a list. So, lists are in principle

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,870
available to combine arbitrary data objects
in Prolog, in order to then work with these

00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:36,075
lists. In the example just now, I had used
lists. In particular already two predicates on

00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,400
lists.

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,690
In fact, there is a very rich supply of
predicates for working with lists in Prolog.

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:50,460
I'll mention three here for now, and then play
around with them a bit, so to speak, on the slides.

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,750
And then also briefly state how
you can define your own predicates.

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:05,110
What already occurred in the previous example is the
member predicate. This is a two-argument predicate.

00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,390
We write it like this through these two here.
So, this will always have two arguments.

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,120
And that is to express that an element occurs in a list. So,
this would have two arguments. The first argument would be

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,340
thought of as an element. Something like Duisburg or
Essen in the example here. So, for example, a constant or

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,320
also another data structure. And the second
argument would be a list. Member expresses,

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,900
that the element in question is in the list and that it is
somewhere. The list does not have to start with the element,

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,540
but somewhere in the list the element must occur somewhere in
the list. Then member would be true. We will see in a moment

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:47,080
how to use member. A second predicate, which also
appeared in the example, was the append predicate.

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,050
This even has three arguments. So, that has three
arguments. The intuition is that all three arguments are

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,150
lists and that the first two lists, when you
append them together, make the third list.

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:05,920
So, we'll see calls in a moment. But you could use, for
example, append, if you read that forward, so to speak,

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,050
by putting two lists in and getting a third list
out, which is then the suffix of the first two

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,510
lists. But like many other predicates also in
Prolog, you can also call append in other ways,

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,990
for example, to decompose a list backwards,
instead of appending two lists forward.

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:29,470
A third very obvious predicate on lists
is a way to determine their length.

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:37,360
This is again a two-argument predicate,
which does not relate elements and lists

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,010
or several lists in relation, but a list and
its length. So, length would have two arguments.

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:54,970
A list and a number. And length with these
arguments is true if said list has said length.

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:03,100
We will see examples of this in a moment as
well. Interesting on all three predicates and

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,920
on many other list predicates in Prolog, is that
they can be used again in the sense of our addition

113 # slide
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,310
backwards, so to speak. We had already
mentioned this several times now,

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:22,410
that we can use the addition, which we defined as a
three-argument predicate, in the end both forwards for adding

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,400
addition, as well as backwards, for example, for
subtraction or to decompose numbers into summands.

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,450
In a similar way, the list predicates
will also support various calling modes.

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,270
So, for example, you can use the member predicate
can be used in the classical way to simply check

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,830
whether an element occurs in a list. So, we
can ask something like the following query:

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:54,480
"Is 3 contained in [1,2,3,4,5]?" And
the answer would obviously be true.

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,880
If we had asked for six here, for example, then
the answer would have been false. So, this is

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,870
the mode, so to speak, where we simply want to know
for given arguments, whether there is such a membership

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:14,940
present. But there is also the possibility to
replace single parts in this query, for example, by

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,340
variables. So, we could, for example, also ask:
"What are all the members of a list [1,3,3]?"

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,030
So, we could ask: "Is there an X such that X
is a member of [1,2,3]?" And if so, we would

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,210
like to get all the answers. And then Prolog would tell us in
that case, "Yes, X can be 1." And then, if we were to go through;

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,020
to see if there are any other solutions, Prolog
would actually enumerate all the members.

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,370
So, then we would get X = 1, or X = 2, or X = 3, because
those are all the members of that list. So, we could

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:56,340
take a list and count it and look at
the individual elements one by one.

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,040
Or we could decide, for example, to
replace the list with a variable.

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:09,810
Or perhaps to have a list whose enumerated
values are replaced by variables.

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,750
For example, we can ask ourselves which
three-element lists contain the 3.

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:22,140
Or what must be present/what must be true, for 3 to
be an element of the list [X,Y,Z], without having

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,020
previously said what X, Y, Z are? So, these are variables.
And there again, Prolog would answer with meaningful answers.

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,440
Namely, Prolog would say, "Yes, X can be 3." Because
then we would have 3 as an element of [3,Y,Z].

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:42,630
And no matter what Y, Z are. Or Y can
be 3. Or Z can be 3. Note that in

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,730
these three cases, there is always only exactly
one variable at a time. Here above there was only

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,880
one variable. It was assigned in three ways. Here now
one of the variables is assigned in each case and

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,090
one after the other, alternatively. And the
other two do not have to be assigned. So, if

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,300
for example, Y = 3, it does not matter what X and Z are.
It would then be true that 3 is an element of [X, 3, Z].

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:14,550
Here below, somehow there is no conjunction. It does
not have to be X, Y, and Z: 3, but really in each case

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:21,480
one of the variables must be 3 and for the other two it
is of no consequence, so nothing more is said about them.

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,740
Even more generally, of course, one could ask
the question: "What if I specify even less here?"

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,800
So, not three-element X, Y, Z, but simply L. If
I were to simply ask, for which L holds that

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,090
3 is a member of L? Then Prolog would have
to respond with an answer that describes or

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,220
covers all cases of all lists in which somehow a 4
occurs, which, of course, is even more general than just

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:52,320
asking under which circumstances 3 is an element
of this three-element list. This is quite powerful,

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,730
although there is only one definition of member,
which we have not seen here now, but which is somehow

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:04,050
built into Prolog. But in principle, it could
also be written itself. In a similar way,

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,150
we also get such call modes and interesting
behavior for the other predicates on lists.

114 # slide
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,150
So, we take for example the append predicate. We
can use that quite classically forward, so to speak.

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,820
We can ask ourselves, for which L is true?
that L is the append of [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5]?

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:28,130
The answer would be unambiguous. There is exactly one answer
to this, namely, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. That would be simply

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:37,280
execution of append. Of an append. But
since Prolog works relationally and we don't

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,570
necessarily have to interpret things
always forward, we could also decide

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,120
for example, to specify the result
list and ask for the input lists.

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,740
In other words, we could ask for the source lists, which, when
put together make the result list. So, a query could look like

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,050
this: We would like to know under which circumstances for
X, Y (which are variables now because they are capitalized)

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,800
under which circumstances X and Y combined make the list
[a, b]. Here 'a' and 'b' are written in lowercase, so they

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,400
are fixed, constant values. And what is the
answer? Again, there are several answers.

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,790
Because there are various possibilities to have two lists in such
a way, so that together they make a two-element list [a, b].

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:28,220
For example, X could be empty and Y the entire
list, or X could be the entire list and Y empty.

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,700
But also the case that actually [a, b] is divided
in the middle, for example, into the list [a] and

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,870
the list [b]. So, the lists [a] and [b]. And
if there were a ten-element list instead,

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,040
then eleven cases would arise. There would be
everything enumerated by Prolog. Every possibility

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:53,450
of a list with at most ten elements and
a corresponding, so to speak, opposite

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,000
shorter list, so that the two lists give
exactly the one given ten-element list.

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,660
So, ultimately, we use append backwards
here, not to append two lists to each other,

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:12,800
but to split a list into two suitable
lists. Namely, so to speak, a cut at some

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,710
place in the given list. Then you could ask
questions to which Prolog might not have an

00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,900
answer, because there is no answer. We could, for example,
ask, for example, under what circumstances is a list

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:34,030
with itself concatenated the list [a, b]? So,
this is a small variation of this example,

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,160
where we use the same variable twice here.
And there we know: Same variable means,

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,090
it must have the same value and there is no way to
have two no possibility to have two equal lists,

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:53,920
so that they add up to [a, b]. We can see that
here already because there is no pair here either,

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,410
where X and Y are equal. If, on the other hand, there were [a, a], for
example, then Prolog would be able to find out that X then obviously must

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,440
be the list with exactly one a. Because then X and X
attached to each other are a two-element list [a, a].

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,660
But if a and b are different here,
then Prolog finds out that there is no

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:17,950
answer to it. So, there is no positive answer. And
again a case where Prolog has to try a little bit more

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,900
effort, but also finds a solution:
We can ask, for example, under what

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,950
circumstances is the case that X and X added to each other
results in the two-element list where the first element is a

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:36,610
and the second element is a variable Y?
Prolog can find out that this is possible.

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:43,180
Namely, exactly when X is the one-element list with
[a]. Prolog can ultimately recognize that from this,

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,700
that X must then begin with a. And then must
also end, so that the total list length reaches

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,310
when doubling X, so to speak.
This is possible because Prolog

00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:00,430
is also able to say: "Y is then also
the small a." Which didn't work here.

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,920
Here there was a contradiction because I
cannot hang two equal lists and keep [a, b].

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,020
If here the Y is a variable, then Prolog can decide,
and Prolog will decide that if you put a small

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:17,080
"a", there is a solution after all. Namely,
X is then the one-element list with an "a".

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,560
So, here Prolog is simply by definition of append Prolog is
able to resolve even somewhat more complicated conditions

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:40,540
and to assign them.
Finally, also from the

115 # slide
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,320
predefined predicates: the length
predicate. This sets a relationship between

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,590
a list and its length. So, classically forward
calculated would be: I give a list [a, b, c],

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:59,620
for example, and ask for the length. There
I can say, for this I take a variable here.

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,140
And then Prolog would answer: "N = 3". Or if I had asked
length([a, b, c], 3) then the answer would be true.

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:15,130
If I had asked length([a, b, c], 4), the answer would
have been false. If I specify a variable, Prolog returns

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:21,910
the correct solution. Can I work backwards here? Can
I instead ask myself what lists of length 3 are?

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,490
That would mean I leave this up front a variable,
say L. And specify the N, for example, 3,

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,940
then [a, b, c] would be an answer, but also many
other lists. So, I would not expect now, if I

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,010
here L and here 3, that only for L exactly this
one list would come out. That would be unusual.

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:47,050
What actually happens? Prolog answers with a list
of length 3, whose elements are listed here.

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,630
look very strange: _ and
something These are basically like

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,760
anonymous variables. We had _ for anonymous
variables. However, they are named.

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,020
Namely, numbered with some internal counters.
It doesn't matter what exactly is written here.

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,670
They can be other numbers in the next execution of
Prolog. Other numbers. What is important is: Prolog has

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,760
invented/introduced three variables here, so to
speak, which did not appear in my query/in my request

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:21,010
and says the answer is a list of length 3, but what the
individual elements are doesn't matter or is unknown.

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,290
That's why there are simply variables.
And if here we had given 4,

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,360
I would have got the structure of a four-element list
and the elements would have been variables again,

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,240
because you don't know more about it and Prolog
does not make more determinations than really

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,710
from the query and the program/the defined
predicates. Now I can combine this a bit

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,320
combined with previous predicates. For
example, with the append predicate.

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,010
For example, I could also say, "I would like to have
all three-element lists that satisfy one more property."

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,290
For example, I could say (going back a bit to an example
from the previous slide): "What are lists of length 3,

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,680
that can also be obtained by
concatenating a list and the same list?"

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,610
The answer is false. Why? Because
if I append a list to the same list

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,930
the result is always an even-length list, and
this contradicts the assumption that the list of

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:30,460
length L should be 3. So, there is no solution
that satisfies both requirements here. And Prolog

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:37,420
also finds out in finite time. If we here instead
want an even length, Prolog can find a solution.

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:45,670
So, we ask L, 4. So, lists of length
4, so that there is a list X such that

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:53,440
X concatenated with X gives L. Then there
are indeed solutions. So, for L = 4 for

00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,490
example, Prolog would then say: "Yes, then L must be
a four-element list. There are variables in it again."

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,990
However, this time there are variables in the
first and second and third and fourth place.

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:11,290
Because to fulfill this requirement
here, it must be the case that actually

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,730
this list L can be decomposed into two equal
lists. And in fact, Prolog also gives for X

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,160
this list and the same variables appear in it again.
The same variables appear in it. Thus, it is expressed,

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,460
that actually some assignment, where we have something
here, have something here, here the first one again,

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,550
here the second again and in X also exactly
these two objects/these two elements, then

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:44,530
and exactly then these are solutions of this query. These
are all possibilities how we can have a list of length 4

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:51,130
which has arisen or can be expressed
as a concatenation of two times of the

00:16:51,130 --> 00:17:00,970
same list. And one more example, where we see
the also with member times in the context. So,

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:10,030
the length and the member predicate. For example,
we can ask: "Are there lists of length 2,

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,610
so that the element a occurs in it, the element b occurs in
it, the element c occurs in it?" That's when Prolog says, "No."

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:25,330
You can think about that indirectly, so to speak,
that this predicate/call says: L must have length 2.

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:32,200
And these three demands together, L
already must contain at least 3 elements.

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,350
Whereas if we were to drop the last one
here, if we were to only make this request,

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:46,420
then Prolog could find solutions. For example, the list
[a,a], [a,b], [b,a], [b,b]. Or exactly these four cases,

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,330
but with the additional requirement that also c
should occur in L we could not find a solution.

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:59,590
And that's what Prolog also states, that there is no solution.
So, this is already quite powerful. Just by combining

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,380
these predefined predicates, we can express
many requirements on lists and let Prolog

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,320
solve them or let Prolog determine that
there is no solution. And of course these

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,430
predefined predicates will also be useful if we want to
express our own functionalities/own predicates on lists

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:29,260
in Prolog. I actually want to do that
on one last slide to do in this video.

116 # slide
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,530
And that is to say, first of all, that if you define
your own predicates, of course, you're going to fall back

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:46,090
to existing predicates. So, an example here: I
would like to express that between an element and

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:53,380
two lists, there is the relationship that if
one inserts X at any place in the list L,

00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:01,210
you can get the list R. And this should
be possible if X is a value and L is,

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:07,480
for example, a list of length N, then
there should be N + 1 possible results.

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,530
So, R stands for result list, and for example one could insert 1
into the list [a,b,c]. And then the result should be: [1,a,b,c],

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:24,730
[a,1,b,c], [a,b,1,c] and [a,b,c,1]. So, all possibilities how
X can be inserted somewhere in L and which R results from it

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,970
is created as a result list. I could be
done somehow recursively, for example.

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,560
Think about an algorithm. Think
about a procedure how to express it.

00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,830
Or I can cleverly exploit the existing predicates
to exploit. So, you could say (that's what this

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:51,760
right side), in order for something like this to be true, in order for
X inserted into L yields R, one would have to insert the X somewhere

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,550
in L, at some particular place. We could
use this 'append' predicate to first split L

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,310
into two parts. With the thought that U
should be the elements that come before the X

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,610
and V the elements that come after the X,
when we form the result list R. So, by using

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:17,020
append(U,V,L), so to speak, we would be implicitly
decomposing L into U and V. And then I could say

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,850
now I just have to insert the X in the
appropriate place. There I could say: "I attach

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:28,030
to each other the U (i.e., the chosen left part
of L) and a one-element list with exactly X."

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:35,290
Then I get some list Y. This contains then all
elements from U. Then the X. And then that's it.

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:42,970
And then I attach to this list, to this Y list, the
second half, so to speak, or the second part of L,

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:50,860
to get a total of R. And that would give me actually
give me exactly this behavior, that I can insert X in

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:59,440
any place in L to get R. So, I would
just encourage here to do exactly that

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,640
in Prolog and then try out some calls to
this 'insert' predicate. You will see that

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,040
without any further programming, simply by
using this append predicate in a clever way,

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:21,190
you get this "insert behavior". This will often show that
we can simply combine existing predicates in a clever way.

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,590
combine them. Or we program with recursion
ourselves. Just as we have done in other

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,160
data structures, on the s(z) numbers, for example,
we have already worked with recursion in the addition

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,790
from the previous lecture, we can also work
on lists. So, for example, we can say,

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:50,230
we would like to permute lists. For that,
I could create the following definition:

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:57,370
So, for example, if I have the list [1,2,3], I would
like to get the list [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], etc.

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:04,300
So, all permutations of a given list. So, I can create a recursion to
create a recursion. Here we remember: a recursion should have a base case.

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,850
An obvious base case here would be to say that the
permutation of the empty list is the empty list.

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:17,650
This is a very simple fact about lists and their permutations.
And that could serve as a base case here at the same time.

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,390
It comes first, as my rules of thumb
say. And then I would expect at least one

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,790
recursive case. In that case,
a recursive case comes with it.

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:35,170
One can ask: "What would need to be done for
non-empty lists?" So, up here, empty lists are

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:42,565
treated exhaustively, so to speak. And then one still
asks oneself what is the case with non-empty lists?

00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:46,030
What distinguishes non-empty lists? Non-empty lists are characterized
by the fact that they start with something and then have a remainder.

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:53,180
So, you can say something like above: Here we
had L decomposed into any two partial lists.

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,090
I can also say, I would like to decompose
L into its first element and the remainder.

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:06,800
I can express this by saying, non-empty lists L
can be represented as the concatenation of some

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:14,930
of a one-element list and another list. What
I implicitly achieve with this call here is,

00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:22,670
that X is set to the first element of the list L
and Y to all remaining elements. Then I can say,

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:30,230
one strategy to permute a list is: to take exactly
the first element and permute the remaining elements

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:36,590
to permute. Then I get lists again. Namely,
lists which are permutations of the rest list.

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,950
And then the first element, which I originally
took from the list L, which I split off here,

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:49,760
back into the permuted remainder list. For this, we
can use our insert predicate / our insert predicate,

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:58,460
which I had not defined recursively here above. So, from the list
L, which is not empty, but decomposable into X and remainder,

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:05,450
permute the remainder and then insert X into this
remainder to get the result/ the result permutation,

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:12,890
which is then also the result of this
permutation call. That would be the short logical

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:20,240
rationale for these two rules. Does this work?
Yes, also there, the encouragement to try this out

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,100
and then, for example, to make calls like:
"What are the permutations of [1,2,3]?".

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,560
That actually comes up with a total of exactly
six lists. We'll see the first two here,

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:41,180
but also all other permutations of [1,2,3]. So,
rearrangements of the elements [1,2,3] would come out here.

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,360
We see here that I have deviated from my rule of thumb
and actually have the recursive call not at the very back,

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,120
but a bit further back/ in the middle.
You could also try this out/ find out,

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,930
if that's important. A little bit of that is
important, where that permutation call is.

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:06,260
Strictly speaking, the permutation predicate
in Prolog is already predefined anyway.

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:14,840
We wouldn't even have to define that ourselves. And
then it is also not visible what this definition is.

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,200
But the predefined permutation predicate also works
forwards and backwards. So, if you want to try

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,860
it out, you should actually not call it permutation, but call
it something else, so that you don't get into conflict with the

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:33,080
predefined Prolog predicate. But as it stands
here, calls of this form would work here.
