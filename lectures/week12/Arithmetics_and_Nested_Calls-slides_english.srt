00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Let us briefly come back to the length example.

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,160
It was one of the examples that I derived in
a previous video from the Haskell version.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,320
So, I started and then I derived this
symbolic version of the length predicate in

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,680
Prolog, which returns, if we give it a list,
the length of that list with this s(s(s(0)))

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,920
constructors.

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,920
Now, we might actually want
to have a true number.

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,720
So, I have to tell you about evaluation.

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,480
Because I have had so far that almost
everything in Prolog is treated symbolically.

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,960
So, even if you write three plus five,
then this is three plus five and not eight.

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,240
So, if you really want to have actual numbers
as a result of "length" as we do in Haskell,

00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,920
we have to do something slightly different
than what I did in the previous video.

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
And indeed, this is how you
could write this in Prolog.

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,040
Yes, so in the previous video,
I didn't have this part here.

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,040
And instead, at this point, I simply had s(M),
with this small s as the successor constructor.

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay, if I want to do actual computation,

00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,560
really computing the output number,
then I have to write it like this.

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,120
I can write M plus one.

00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,920
But in order to not have this just as symbolic
M plus one, to really have the resulting number,

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,440
I can say something like M is this thing.

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,960
And then I can put the N here.

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,480
And then this will really mean that this
arithmetic expression is really computed

00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,920
down to a number and that is
the number that then is the N.

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,760
Okay, so reformulating the version from the

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,720
slides in this way for explicit number
computations, we get to this version.

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,120
And then, indeed, we can ask questions
like, what's the length of this list?

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,200
Well, this is the mixed list because unlike
in Haskell, we don't have homogeneous lists.

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
So, this is a valid Prolog list

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,160
that wouldn't be a valid list to give
to Haskell, to the Haskell function.

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
And I ask about the result.

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,720
And then what do I get?

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,040
Well, I get as a result really the number
three and not s of s of s of zero.

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,980
Okay.

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:22,240
And, of course, I can also do now
kind of backward queries, right?

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Remember that once we have rewritten the
Haskell function to a Prolog predicate,

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,240
we are not doomed to only use
it in exactly one direction.

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
So, for example, I could
also say, well, what if I

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,800
give a number here and ask for
lists of that number as its length?

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Okay, so this is of course
not possible in Haskell.

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,600
In Prolog, you could ask a question like this.

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,560
What is a list?

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,320
(so, using a variable here)
that has length three?

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,520
Okay, now, what could we expect?

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Of course, you could say well
maybe this is the answer,

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,520
because Prolog has simply seen this already.

00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,960
But that would be very specific
to answer with the list [1,2,a].

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,880
Instead, what Prolog really should do
is to give all the possible answers.

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,880
Now, what are all lists of length three?

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, there are far too many to
really write them down one by one.

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,320
But it's possible to write them
down in a very general way.

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,640
Namely, by saying well, all the
lists of length three are these ones.

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay.

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
And here, you see something
that I already mentioned,

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
when I talked about the
syntax of variables in Prolog.

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
Where I said that sometimes
Prolog uses the underscore,

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,080
and then some cryptic combination of letters and
numbers when it has to introduce a new variable.

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
So, what this is basically saying is, well,

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,760
if you want to have a list of length three,
then, well, it should be of this form.

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
And these three things are anything, right?

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,320
Something we don't care or
we don't know anything about.

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,840
So, these are three variables.

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,880
Three different variables because
the list could have different

00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,600
entries here and still be a list of length three.

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, so this is saying that a list with three
arbitrary elements, and arbitrary, of course,

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,200
in the sense that we're just having a variable
there means that it could be filled with anything.

37 # slide
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,240
Okay, then there is one reason for caution.

00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,360
Actually related to this issue of
arithmetic versus symbolic interpretation

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,600
(of addition or of this operation).

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,840
So, we could have attempted to actually write
something like this without this "is" keyword

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
for triggering an actual computation.

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes, just saying well, the length
of the empty list is zero,

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,080
the length of a non-empty list is M plus
one where M is the length of Xs, right?

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,280
So, that would be a shorter way to write
this, but it wouldn't have the same outcome.

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,000
Because now this would again be treated

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
fully symbolically just as if I
had used the s(M) syntax here.

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
So, this plus one doesn't mean that
one takes a number and adds one to it,

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,800
it simply means that one builds the syntax
expression, a syntax tree with plus at the root

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,560
to the left, whatever N is, and
to the right, this constant one.

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,280
So, while this is something one
could write in Prolog, so it is

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,840
not the point that we can't use
this, but it has a different result.

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
So, for example, if we now compute
the length of this list [1,2,a] again,

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
we don't get three, we get zero
plus one plus one plus one.

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
So, this is kept as a symbolic expression.

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,840
It's not computed down to the actual value three.

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Okay, and then you would say, well,

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
what's the problem that this is
zero plus one plus one plus one?

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
And then I compute this down to three.

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Well, there are other side
effects or side issues.

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,320
So, for example, where previously I could say,

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,320
give me all the lists of length three, and then
I got this useful thing with the three variables.

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,080
If I do this now for this predicate
and I ask what are the lists of

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,760
length three, then the answer is false.

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,720
Which means no, there are no lists of
that length, which is very surprising.

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,200
But it has to do with the fact that Prolog
will not treat this three the same as

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,560
zero plus one plus one plus one, because
this is kept as a symbolic expression.

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
So, indeed, we could, for example,
still ask Prolog, what are

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,760
lists of length zero plus one plus one plus one?

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,440
And it would give this result.

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,960
But if you ask it for lists of length
three, it wouldn't be able to answer this.

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,880
Because with this version of the predicate
numbers are treated fully symbolically,

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,800
so Prolog will not somehow make a match between this
zero plus one plus one plus one and this three.

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
It's simply not happening here.

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,800
Because we are not doing function evaluation,

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,480
unless we use special things
like for numbers.

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,560
Yes, this is what makes a difference.

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
Which brings us from this down to three.

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Okay, that's something I want
to show on this example.

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
And then I have another example.

38 # slide
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,560
And I don't think I will talk
through this example in detail.

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
So, it is on the slides, you
can follow the development here.

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,600
So, the idea here is that
again, take a Haskell function.

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,960
So, this is not exactly the Quicksort version
we saw earlier in the Haskell course part.

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
But well, it's related to that, certainly.

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,040
So, let's say we have a partition function,
which can be used to partition a list

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,000
according to some pivot element into smaller and
greater list elements or in the earlier Haskell

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,600
version of this program in this slide I
used list comprehensions for doing this.

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,040
But let's say this is simply a function,
however, it is implemented in detail.

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
And then a Quicksort of the empty list is

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,400
the empty list. A Quicksort of something else
is partitioning according to this head element.

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,760
And then properly combining the results
with recursive calls and append, etc.

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,800
So, this is an example where
we have several nested calls.

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,080
And the message of this slide
is mainly how to treat this.

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,640
And the answer is well, treat it in the way
we have done for the simpler examples as well.

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:18,800
So, avoid these nested function calls by
introducing names for the subexpressions,

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,320
or subexpressions if there are several ones.

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,240
And add local definitions,
and later interpret these as

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,320
additional preconditions
when writing down a rule.

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:40,080
Yes, so one first step could be to introduce a
name "ls" for lowers for this first recursive call.

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:48,160
And something similar, the greater list
elements (lg) for the second subexpression here.

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Okay, then you also have this append, which
essentially is also a nested function call, right?

00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,000
It calls a function on this
and this subexpression.

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
So, we need to also deal with this.

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:12,960
Nice to not have these full nested function
calls on the right-hand side and instead have

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,000
a variable here so that you can easily
rewrite this rule in predicate form.

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
So, let's also introduce a name for this.

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,160
So, that should be the result,
this list. This is this expression.

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,640
And then, for example,
these two lines are already

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
in the form where we can directly
translate them to predicate form.

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,160
And likewise, here because you always have
variables on the input and output sides,

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,400
we don't have any nested calls anymore.

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Okay, so that's how this could then be written.

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
Yes, so quicksort of the
empty list is the empty list.

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
That's a translation of the first equation here.

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then this is now systematic

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,520
unlike here, where we wouldn't probably
see direct matching to the Prolog side.

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,880
So, quicksort of head and tail is some list.

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,760
Alright, that's a translation of this line if ...,
and then we list all the preconditions, which are the

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,960
dependencies introduced in
these local definitions.

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,240
For example, that partition.

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,800
So, let's say, partition here was a
function with two arguments, two outputs.

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,960
Now on the Prolog side, this would simply turn
into predicates with four argument positions.

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Two for the inputs, and two for the outputs.

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,560
So, with this call partition
of h and t is the outcome.

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,960
l1 and l2 would turn into a literal

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,000
with this partition predicate
with four argument positions.

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,520
They have the tail as the inputs
and l1, l2 as the outputs.

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
So, the input-output is just by convention,

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
because here, the first list is
the inputs and then the outputs.

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,400
That's not something that the predicate partition
itself expresses in its type or something.

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
Because there's no type.

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
Okay, and then you have these
recursive calls of the function here,

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
they now turn into preconditions
referring to the same predicate,

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,440
quicksort of l1 is ls, quicksort of l1 is ls,
quicksort of l2 is lg, quicksort of l2 is lg.

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,960
And then this append-operator from the
Haskell side can now be replaced by the

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,440
append predicate that was actually introduced
in the previous video, as an example.

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,280
So, what you have here is ls appended with
H, the list [H|LG] should be the result list.

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,640
Let's turn this into a call
of the predicate append.

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,440
The one list, the other list in this Prolog
syntax for lists and the one variable,

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,000
which is, at the same time, also the output
variable of the current quicksort case.

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,560
Okay, and now, if you run this, together with an
implementation for partition and the implementation

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,520
for append that was developed in the previous
video, then you have a Quicksort in Prolog.

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,640
And then the main message is to get rid of
these nested function calls via this chaining

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,960
of predicates with the downside that for this,
we have to introduce new variable names, right?

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,240
So, these ls, lg these are things we didn't need,
indeed, to express the original Haskell version.

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,680
Okay, but we gain that now we at least can hope
that we can also call this quicksort predicate

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,640
in different ways than just giving it
an input and asking for the output.
